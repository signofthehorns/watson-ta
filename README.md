- Project:
  > We plan on making the Watson TA. It will be a web app where students can upload a school assignment (homework, quiz, test, etc.) and Watson will tell the student if his/her answer is correct or not, give its own top 2 or 3 answers, and allow the student to drag and drop his/her favorite answer if the student wishes to take one of the suggested ones.
  >
  > Extensions:
  > - add 24/7 office hour TA so students can ask questions if they don't understand the suggested answers.
