1. Introduction and Use of the Flight SimulatorSpend time using Microsoft Flight Simulator 2000/2002 to learn to take off and fly an aircraft.We suggest that you use a simple single engine aircraft model (i.e., Cessna 
2. Airspeed and Vertical Speed Performance in a Steady GlideWe will focus on collecting performance data from an aircraft in a steady glide. We will use aSchweizer 2-32 glider rather than a powered aircraft, which simplifies some of the calculations.You will put the glider into a series of steady flight conditions and record speed and verticalspeed (descent rate). Using these data, you will build a plot that describes how these parametersare related, and then you will be able to compute some of the critical aerodynamic performanceparameters, such as parasite drag coefficient and L/D ratio. These data would be very importantto a prospective buyer, for example. The methods you will use are similar to what might be donewhen evaluating an actual aircraft.First, you can measure some of the characteristics of the Schweizer 2-32 sailplane before you take off: 850 lb 57 ft Weight (W): Wing span (b): Mean wing chord (c): 
3) the speed shown on the dial equals the true speed of the aircraft through the air. In a sense, you can think of the airspeed indicator as a dynamic pressure gauge (because dynamic pressure = P0-P) that has been calibrated to show the actual airspeed for that dynamic pressure if the aircraft is at sea level in standard conditions. So, an indicated airspeed reading of 100 MPH means that the dynamic pressure is such that were the aircraft at sea level, it would be traveling at a true speed of 100 MPH through the air. At high altitudes, however, a given indicated airspeed based on the pressure difference (P0-P) actually means that the aircraft is moving more quickly through the air because the air density is less than at sea level. At 10,000 ft, air density is about 
1.  Performance prediction We will begin by predicting the performance of a model rocket while ignoring the effects of drag, wind, or the mass change as fuel is burned. Assume that the rocket thrust is maintained at a constant elevation angle until burnout, after which the rocket flies ballistically. 1 Assume the following parameters are known: Average rocket motor thrust: T Rocket motor burn time: tb Total rocket mass: m (assumed constant) Launch elevation angle: (cid:
2.  Concept Development As a group, brainstorm as many rocket design concepts as you can (varying body length, fin layout, etc.), and then downselect to at least three different likely design concepts. Sketch each of these three designs – these need not be engineering drawings, but just conceptual sketches. Also briefly describe the advantages and disadvantages of each of the three design concepts. Create a Product Design Matrix that includes all of the design requirements you can identify (see the <LTA.pdf> lecture notes file on the 
3.  Detailed Design Carefully measure and weigh the rocket components in your rocket kit. Then, generate a detailed design for your rocket. This should include: Engineering drawings (side and top views, dimensioned) Computation of the center of mass position (CM), measured from the nose of the rocket Computation of the center of pressure position (CP) using the Barrowman method (detailed on the Rocket Stability handout, linked to the syllabus) Safety Margin:  (CM – CP) / D, where D is the body diameter. Desired launch elevation angle Computation of the maximum altitude and downrange distance your rocket will fly, and the expected % increase or decrease relative to the calibration rocket 2Your rocket must have a Safety Margin of at least 1, so make and document revisions to your design as necessary. 
4.  Construction Build the rocket to the specifications in your engineering drawings. After it is built, double- check the center of mass position by balancing the rocket on your finger or a small dowel and comparing against your estimate from part 
5.  Launch A sign-up sheet of flight times will be posted for dates on March 13 – March 
6.  Final Report Make a single, final team report that includes the following elements: •  Team member names and each member’s specific contribution to the project •  Performance analysis from parts 1(a) – 1(c) •  Design concepts, sketches, and a Product Design Matrix. •  Detailed design, including all elements listed in part 3 •  Any notes on modifications made to the design during or after construction •  A brief flight report, documenting downrange distance flown and comparing this to the calibration rocket and to your predictions. Discuss what contributed to any discrepancies. Also describe and discuss the overall performance of your rocket, whether it met (or didn’t meet) your expectations, failed, etc. 3Rocket Construction Tips As a team, pick up your rocket kit from the TAs in the Gelb lab. Carefully measure and weigh each component so that you can design and analyze your rocket before actually building it. You may want to shorten the body tube and will make your own fins from balsa sheet. You can predict the mass of the fins or body by first determining each part’s mass/length or mass/area and then multiplying by the designed length or area. You only get one chance to build the rocket from the supplied materials, so be sure to carefully plan out your design before construction. Fins will be strongest when the wood grain runs parallel to the leading edge of the fin. Lightly sanding the rocket body will make the fin attachments stronger when adhesive is applied. The rocket is launched on a launcher that consists of a steel rod inclined at your chosen launch elevation angle. A short (1-2” long) plastic launch guide tube (a piece of a drinking straw) must be attached to the side of your rocket. Attach the tube starting approximately 2” from the bottom of the rocket, and ensure that the tube is parallel with the rocket body.  Inclining the guide tube or fins will cause your rocket to spin about its long axis – this will decrease the energy that is applied toward the rocket’s forward kinetic energy, reducing its flight distance. The rocket motors have a diameter less than that of the body tube. The rocket motor should first be mounted inside a smaller short tube that exactly fits the motor (provided in your kit), and then design a mount using balsa strips to hold the motor + tube inside the body tube. Design this mount so that the motor assembly fits tightly in the body without any adhesive, which will let you remove the used motor after your launch so the rocket can be reused if you’d like. Because the motor is not glued in place, you will also need to make and glue some form of stop inside the main rocket body to prevent the rocket motor from moving or pushing up inside the body during launch. 2” guide tube fin wood grain rocket body 4

A force F is applied in a symmetric manner so that angles FAC and FAB are both 120°.  Angle CAB is also 120°.  The springs are joined or attached by hinges at A, B and C which can rotate freely.  Your task is to determine the displacement of point A. You can assume that the springs are sufficiently stiff that the deflections and the displacements are small, so that the geometry of the structure will not change significantly due to the loading. (a)	(b) (i)	 Determine the forces in the springs.  Assume that the springs can be replaced by reaction forces, RAB and RAC  acting in the same directions as the springs (i.e at angles of 30° to the line AC) as shown in figure (b).  Apply equilibrium to calculate the forces RAB and RAC. (ii)	 Calculate the extension of each spring.  You can assume that the extension of the each of the springs is determined by the spring constant, k, and the force in the spring R, such that the spring will elongate by an amount, δ,  according  to: R = kδ (iii)	 Calculate the deflection (displacement) of point A.  Use the results from part (b) as the extension of the springs.  Use trigonometry, and the knowledge that the springs each remain attached at C and B and are joined at A, to calculate how much point A displaces. Uniﬁed  Engineering  I Problem  U2 (Uniﬁed Concepts) Fall ’03 Dimensions  and  units  are  fundamental  to  the  language  of  engineering.

As  the airfoil  ﬂies  through  this  gust  ﬁeld,  the  leading  edge  of  the  airfoil  “sees”  a  variation in  the  angle  of  attack.  If  w  is  small  compared  to  U ,  then  the  angle  of  attack  change seen  by  the  airfoil  is  α  =  w/U .  Since  the  velocity  proﬁle  varies  in  space,  the  angle  of attack  seen  by  the  airfoil  is  a  function  of  time,  α(t). One  might  expect  that  the  lift  coeﬃcient  of  the  airfoil  is  just CL(t)  = 2πα(t) However,  the  airfoil  does  not  respond  instantaneously  as  the  airfoil  encounters  the gust.  If  the  airfoil  encounters  a  “sharp­edged  gust,”  so  that  the  apparent  change  in the  angle  of  attack  is  a  step  function  in  time, then  the  change  in  lift  is  given  by α(t) =  α0σ(t) CL(t)  = 2πα0ψ(t¯) where  t¯ = 2U t/c  is  the  dimensionless  time.  ψ(t¯)  is  the  K¨ussner  function,  and  is the  step  response  of  the  airfoil  (neglecting  multiplicative  constants),  if  the  input  is considered  to  be  the  vertical  gust  at  the  leading  edge  as  a  function  of  time,  and  the output  is  considered  to  be  the  lift  as  a  function  of  time.

Label all key values (i.e. where changes in magnitude or slope occur). Maintain the convention shown below for positive shear forces and bending moments: Spring 2004 Problem M4 The spar in a wing is modeled as a 10 m long beam.  The combination of lift and self-weight is modeled as resulting in a load distribution varying linearly from 5kN/m at the root to zero at the tip.  The beam has a rectangular cross section, height, h, of 100 mm and breadth, b, of 50 mm.  Calculate the maximum bending stress in the beam, stating its location(s) and calculate the deflection of the tip of the beam Problem M5 A simply supported beam, length 3L, is loaded by a load P applied at a distance of L from the left hand end.  The beam has a flexural stiffness EI. a)  Calculate the deflection of the beam as a function of position along the beam.b)  Calculate the maximum deflection of the beam and state its location.c)  Calculate the location at which the bending moment is a maximum (is this the same asfor (b)?) Problem M6 This question is a first step towards designing a beam-like structure – e.g. a wing.  You are asked to specify a material for a cantilever beam (i.e. a beam clamped at one end) which is to be of a specified length, L, and to be of the lowest possible mass to support a load, P, applied at its tip while minimizing the tip deflection, d, without failing. a) Assuming that the beam is constrained to have a solid square cross-section, side, h, express the mass of the beam, m, in terms of, L, the relevant material properties and the stiffness of the beam (P/ d).  ( Note: The key to achieving this is to eliminate the cross-sectional dimension, h, from the expression).  What is the figure of merit (combination of material properties) that must be minimized in order to achieve the lightest weight beam for a given desired stiffness? b) If instead of a requirement on minimizing deflection the beam is required to support the same load, P, without exceeding the failure strength, sf?  What should the figure of merit for selecting a material now be in order to create a beam of minimum 2 mass?.  Assume that failure will occur when the maximum bending stress equals the strength of the material. c)  For the materials listed in the table below, identify the material(s) that you would choose to meet the criteria of part (a) and part (b).  What other factors should be considered in selecting a material for this application?. d) Square solid sections are structurally not very efficient – “I” beams or hollow “box” beams are much more efficient – why is this?  What other factors would need to be considered in selecting a material if a “box” cross-section was to be considered in (c)?.

As  the airfoil  ﬂies  through  this  gust  ﬁeld,  the  leading  edge  of  the  airfoil  “sees”  a  variation in  the  angle  of  attack.  If  w  is  small  compared  to  U ,  then  the  angle  of  attack  change seen  by  the  airfoil  is  α  =  w/U .  Since  the  velocity  proﬁle  varies  in  space,  the  angle  of attack  seen  by  the  airfoil  is  a  function  of  time,  α(t). One  might  expect  that  the  lift  coeﬃcient  of  the  airfoil  is  just CL(t)  = 2πα(t) However,  the  airfoil  does  not  respond  instantaneously  as  the  airfoil  encounters  the gust.  If  the  airfoil  encounters  a  “sharp­edged  gust,”  so  that  the  apparent  change  in the  angle  of  attack  is  a  step  function  in  time, then  the  change  in  lift  is  given  by α(t) =  α0σ(t) CL(t)  = 2πα0ψ(t¯) where  t¯ = 2U t/c  is  the  dimensionless  time.  ψ(t¯)  is  the  K¨ussner  function,  and  is the  step  response  of  the  airfoil  (neglecting  multiplicative  constants),  if  the  input  is considered  to  be  the  vertical  gust  at  the  leading  edge  as  a  function  of  time,  and  the output  is  considered  to  be  the  lift  as  a  function  of  time.

1. (Propulsion) Spring Term 2003 a. 	 Consider a turbojet powered aircraft during landing with the throttles set to some fraction of that required to achieve take-off thrust.  As the aircraft is rolling down the runway at 60m/s, the engine consumes 150kg/s of air and produces an exhaust jet velocity of 200m/s. What is the thrust of the engine?  (Assume that the exhaust jet is ideally expanded and that the mass flow rate of fuel is small compared to the mass flow rate of the air.) b. 	 Now suppose that the pilot engages the thrust reversers which deflect the engine exhaust normal to the direction of travel (say half up and half down) without affecting the operating condition of the engine. What is the magnitude and direction (i.e. forward or reverse) of the thrust produced by the engine? c. 	 With the thrust reversers still engaged, the aircraft comes to a stop on the taxiway. The engine is now consuming 80 kg/s of air and producing an exhaust velocity of 150 m/s. What is the magnitude and direction (i.e. forward or reverse) of the thrust produced by the engine? d.

2. (Propulsion) Spring Term 2003 There is a test facility at NASA Langley Research Center where a hydraulic catapult is used to accelerate vehicles.  It provides an instructive illustration of the integral momentum theorem. Vj, A, ρ Nozzle Vj - V Vj - V V S1 Mass of Airplane, M T F Bucket S2a) Explain what each term in the equation of motion represents. b) Derive an equation of motion for the airplane acceleration (dV(t)/dt) as a function of the velocity, area, and density of the water jet (Vj, Aj and ρj respectively), and the mass (m) and velocity (V) of the airplane.  Neglect the effects of gravity and assume the forces associated with the air around the vehicle and launcher are small compared to those associated with the water jet.  Assume the mass of water in contact with and accelerating the bucket is negligible relative to M so you can neglect any change with time of the momentum of the jet within the control volume. c) What is the thrust, T, on the airplane? Uniﬁed  Engineering  II	Spring  2004 Problem  S8  (Signals  and  Systems) This  problem  shows  why  a  radar  system  sends  out  a  chirp,  which  has  a  broad  range of  frquencies  in  the  signal,  and  not  a  short  sinusoidal  pulse,  which  is  at  a  single frequency.  To  see  why  a  sinusoidal  pulse  doesn’t  work  well,  let’s  try  a  radar  signal u(t)  =	sin(2πt),  −3  ≤ t  ≤ 0 otherwise 0, � � The  matched  ﬁlter  for  this  pulse  has  impulse  response g(t) =  u(−t) = sin(−2πt),  0  ≤ t  ≤ 3 otherwise 0, The  radar  sends  out  a  signal,  u(t),  that  reﬂects  oﬀ  the  aircraft  and  returns  to  the radar  system.  The  time  it  takes  the  signal  to  return  is  twice  the  distance  to  the aircraft,  divided  by  the  speed  of  light.  The  received  signal  is  u(t− T ),  where  T  is  the round  trip  travel  time  of  the  signal.  For  the  purposes  of  this  problem,  we  can  ignore the  time  delay,  T ,  and  just  look  at  how  the  matched  ﬁlter  response  to  u(t).

3. (Propulsion) (LO A & B) An incompressible fluid flows steadily through a two-dimensional infinite row of fixed airfoils (e.g. a stator blade row). The blade row is contained in a constant area annulus, as shown on the right side of the figure below. The spacing between the airfoils is s. Assume that the velocities and pressures Va, Vb, pa, pb, are constant at stations (a) and (b), and that the flow angles are given by βa and βb. a) Does the magnitude of the flow velocity increase/stay the same/decrease across the stator and why? b) Using the control volume shown above (the upper and lower surfaces are streamlines), apply conservation of mass and momentum to determine the forces Rx and Ry that must be applied to the fluid (these are equal and opposite to the forces needed to keep each vane in place). Unified Engineering Spring Term 2004 Problem P

[The turbine can be run in conditions well above the melting temperature of the metal because air from the exit of the compressor is used to "cool" the turbine. This air is pumped through the turbine blades and forced out small holes in the surface forming a protective film (see picture below from Rolls-Royce, The Jet Engine). Due to their very small size, it is much harder to cool the compressor blades, so no active cooling is currently used.] Reproduced with the kind permission of Rolls-Royce plc.

2)  (16%,  partial  credit  given) Explain how a refrigerator works in terms of energy, heat and work. (LO# 2, 
3) The objective of a refrigerator is to lower the internal energy of a body at low temperature (the food) and transfer that energy to the higher temperature surroundings (the room the refrigerator is in).  It requires work (typically in the form of electrical energy) to do this.  Most refrigerators employ a thermodynamic cycle with refrigerant circulating around a loop.  As the refrigerant circulates around the loop, its internal energy (and temperature) is alternately raised and lowered by a series of devices.  First the internal energy is lowered either by passing through a small turbine or through an expansion valve.  In these devices, work is done by the refrigerant so its internal energy is  lowered.  The internal energy is lowered to a point where the temperature of the refrigerant is lower than that of the air in the refrigerator.  A heat exchanger is used to transfer energy from the air (and food) in the refrigerator to the cold refrigerant (energy transferred by virtue of a temperature difference only = heat).  This lowers the internal energy of the air/food and raises the internal energy of the refrigerant.  Then a pump or compressor is used to do work on the refrigerant adding additional energy to it and thus further raising its internal energy. Electrical energy is used to drive the pump or compressor.  The internal energy of the refrigerant is raised to a point where its temperature is hotter than the temperature of the room. The refrigerant is then passed through a heat exchanger (the coils at the back of the refrigerator) so that energy is transferred from the refrigerant to the surroundings.  As a result, the internal energy of the refrigerant is reduced and the internal energy of the surroundings is increased.  It is at this point where the internal energy of the food and the energy used to drive the compressor or pump are transferred to the surroundings.  The refrigerant then continues on to the turbine, repeating the cycle. 4Unified Engineering Quiz 1Fall 2003NAME              WAITZ SOLUTIONS

1. (15 points, partial credit given, L.O. C & D) What are the principal figures of merit for an engine of this type and why?  When answering this question be sure to describe how these figures of merit are related to overall vehicle performance. The principal figures of merit for gas turbine engine performance are max-thrust, overall propulsive efficiency, impact on  vehicle weight and impact on vehicle drag.  These parameters directly impact mission performance for example: L Range =  hoverall D h g ln Winitial  and for  maneuvering:  TV - DV = W Wfinal dh dt + d Ê 1 W  Ádt Ë2  gˆV 2 ˜ ¯For this vehicle, the engine configuration alone suggests that maneuvering, especially vertical take-off and landing, is of great importance to the mission.  Therefore an additional figure of merit would be the capability to reconfigure or vector the thrust. In addition to the performance figures of merit, it is important to add cost (acquisition cost and non-fuel operating costs). 2 Unified Engineering Propulsion Quiz Spring 2004 NAME: SOLUTIONS ___

4. (20 points, partial credit given, L.O. C & E) You are given the design for a rotor for an existing turbopump for a rocket engine.  As part of an effort to improve the vehicle performance you are considering a new material for the rotor.  The properties of the new material are such that the rotor would be heavier, but you would be able to spin it faster. What impacts might this have on vehicle performance and why? Please present the equations and concepts you would use to connect a change in turbopump rotor speed, to changes in principal figures of merit for a rocket motor, to changes in vehicle performance. Discuss the trade-offs for this new material—which parameters would increase, which would stay the same, which would decrease? Start with the Euler turbine equation: Power =w (mass flow)(routvout-rinvin).  Spinning the rotor faster would enable increased w and probably increased vout (since the tangential speed of the flow at the exit of the centrifugal turbopump would be closely related to the tangential speed of the rotor).  So if the power increases then from the steady flow energy equation the change in stagnation enthalpy across the pump will increase.  Power = m_dot(hTout-hTin) assuming adiabatic flow. \ This will enable the propellants to be delivered to the combustion chamber at higher pressure and temperature.  So when they react the pressure and temperature will be higher.  This will increase the exit velocity of the rocket (again from the steady flow energy equation for an adiabatic expansion with no shaft work): ue Ê=  2CpTc Í 1 - Á Pe ˆ˜ Ë Pc ¯È ÍÎ g -1 ˘g ˙˙˚The higher exit velocity will increase the specific impulse (Isp=ue/g).  There will also be a higher mass flow through the nozzle since the upstream stagnation temperature and pressure are higher (although we haven’t handled this very well in terms of the impact of 5mass flow changes on pump performance).  This will reduce the burn time for a given propellant mass.  And the weight of the rocket motor will increase since the rotor will be heavier.  Thus, the impacts on the principal figures of merit are that Isp will increase, rocket motor weight will increase, and the overall thrust will increase since the mass flow and exit velocity will increase.  These changes would be reflected in the vehicle performance (for a simple single stage sounding rocket for example) as shown in the Rocket Equation: u = g  Isp ln ÁÈ ÍÎ Ê mvo ˆ˜ - t ˘˙Ë  mv  ¯ ˚ Ê  m v ˆo  ˜lnÁÁ˜Ë m vfinal  ¯ ÈÍ Í - t bIsp h  = gÍ ˆ Ê  m v Í Á˜ - 1 Á˜ ÍÎ Ë m vfinal  ¯b+ t bIsp -o12˘ ˙ 2 ˙ t b  ˙ ˙ ˙˚ Isp would increase, the vehicle initial to final mass ratio would decrease, and burn time would decrease.

5. (25 points, partial credit given, L.O. G) Three rows of turbomachine blades are shown below.  At inlet to the first blade row, the flow is purely axial.  Assume that the axial component of velocity (w) then remains constant through the stage. Vb = wb Vb ’ wr a) (5 pts) Describe in words the energy exchange processes in each of the three blade rows shown in the figure. IGV: A nozzle—it accelerates the flow without changing the energy (or more appropriately the total enthalpy).  Converts internal energy to swirling kinetic energy. ROTOR: Increases the swirling kinetic energy, increasing the overall energy (total enthalpy) of the flow. STATOR: A diffuser—it slows the flow down without changing the energy (total enthalpy).  Converts swirling kinetic energy to internal energy. 7 Unified Engineering Propulsion Quiz Spring 2004 NAME: SOLUTIONS ___ b) (5 pts) Which of the three blade rows experiences torque?  Why? All three blade rows experience a torque since the tangential velocity in the stationary frame changes across each of the blade rows (however, it is only the moving blade that does work changing the total enthalpy of the flow). Torque =(mass flow)(routvout-rinvin) c) (15pts) If the first blade row (the inlet guide vanes, IGV) were to be removed, with all else staying the same, would the magnitude of work for the device increase, decrease or stay the same?  Why?  Substantiate you answer by drawing the appropriate velocity triangles to the right of the figure on the preceding page. The work would increase since the change in stationary frame tangential velocity across the moving blade row in the direction of rotor motion would increase. Power =w(mass flow)(routvout-rinvin),  vout remains the same, vin is reduced to zero. See drawing on previous page. 8

(We will use the results of this problem later in the term, so all is not lost.  And I am actually going to  tell  you  how  to  do  it,  step  by  step.  The  steps  are  not  unique,  there  are  many  way  to accomplish this.) a)	 First, perform a coordinate transformation by a rotation q about the z axis.  Since we wish  to  have  the  X”  coordinate  line  up  with  the  center  of  the  cube,  θ  =  45  degrees. Relate X’ to x through the ﬁrst transformation matrix. b)	 Now  perform  a  rotation  about  the  Y’  axis  to  position  the  X”  axis  through  the  upper corner of the cube.  What angle y is required for this rotation?  Relate X” to X’ through the second transformation matrix. c)	 Now  relate  X”  to  x  through  a  suitable  multiplication  of  the  transformation  matrices. Do  this  step  numerically  using  the  matrix  manipulation  routines  of  MATLAB.  Save this matrix, you will use it again. d)	 Check your answer by transforming the vector V=1,1,1 in the x coordinate system to the X” system.  What should you get in the X” system? MIT OpenCourseWarehttp://ocw.mit.edu

Stop  the  problem  when  the center of mass of the upper block reaches the edge of block 2, i.e.  a slip of 1m. Problem  4 (10 points)(MATLAB  exercise)  MATLAB  problem  philosophy:  treat  this  problem  like any other homework problem, but use MATLAB as a means to understand the problem and run cases.  Your writeup should discuss the questions asked and  interpret  the  results  obtained  using  MATLAB  as  a  means  to  generate the results.  Include graphs of numerical results as called for in the problem statement.  You  need  not  include  your  code  in  the  writeup,  but  you  must submit  your  code  on  line. We are going to consider the reentry of a vehicle through the atmosphere.  (Having tried this problem myself, I know that typical numerical methods go crazy when encountering the  very  large  derivatives  that  can  occur  in  this  problem  if  the  reentry  angle  is  too steep.  Therefore,  we  are  going  to  sneak  up  on  this  problem.  That  is  the  reason  why the problem has so many parts; in the end it will save you time.) A reasonable ﬁt to the density of the atmosphere is ρ(y) =

3.  (entering  the  twilight  zone) A very important property of orbits comes from  a  remarkable  result  known  as  the  image  theorem,  which  states  that  in  general a  trajectory  cannot  be  ﬂown  in  reverse  back  to  its  original  point,  but  that  we  can ﬂy  its  image,  as  sketched  in  the  ﬁgure.  (The  deﬁnition  of  the  image  trajectory  is the  trajectory  reﬂected  about  a  line  from  the  origin  to  the  beginning  of  the  image ﬂight.)  That  is  we  can  start  from  point  2,  and  ﬂy  the  image  trajectory  by  reversing the  initial  condition  on  the  x  velocity  leaving  the  y  velocity  unchanged,  as  sketched. The importance of this profound result is that while we cannot get back to earth from the  moon  by  ﬂying  back  along  our  original  trajectory,  we  can  ﬂy  back  on  the  image trajectory, whew!!!! Run your calculations with initial conditions for Case  3 given by the ﬁnal conditions of  Case  1  but  switched  to  ﬂy  the  image  trajectory:  the  initial  position  is  x3i(

In  all  the  conﬁgurations,  a  mass  m  traveling  at  velocity  V0 impacts another mass m which is at rest. a)  In the ﬁrst example, the mass is suspended by a string from a ﬁxed support in the presence of gravity.  What is the tension in the string immediately after the collision? b)  In the second example, the mass is suspended by a massless rigid rod which is fee to rotate about an axel ﬁxed to the support in the presence of gravity.  What is the force in the rod immediately after the collision? c)  In the ﬁnal example, the mass system consists of a dumbbell, two equal masses connected by a massless rod resting on a frictionless plane.  What is the force is the rod immediately after the collision? Problem  3 (10 points) Part A Two masses  m1  = m and  m2  =3m resting on a frictionless  plane are joined together by a spring of length L0  which has been compressed from its equilibrium length of Leq .  The spring has a spring constant k.  The conﬁguration is held together by a string which keeps the spring compressed. At t = 0, the string is cut. •  How much elastic energy is stored in the system before t=0? •  What happens when the string is cut? •  Is there a necessary relationship between the motion of m1  and m2? •  What is the maximum kinetic energy of the system? •  For what relative position (distance) between the masses does this occur? •  The resulting motion will be a sinusoidal oscillation.

1)  A  spacecraft  returns  from  the  moon  on  the  trajectory  shown.  We  wish  to  place the  spacecraft  in  a  circular  parking  orbit  at  a  radius  Ro  = 3 × Re,  where  Re  is  the radius  of  the  earth.  Then  at  a  later  time,  we  wish  to  return  the  spacecraft  to  an elliptical orbit that includes a point B  on the earth, ignoring the rotation of the earth and atmospheric drag.  At the ﬁnal step, we wish to bring the velocity of the spacecraft to zero and land on a non-rotating earth.  The ﬁnal steps–ignoring the rotation of the earth and atmospheric drag– are quite unrealistic but give a ballpark understanding. This time, do the numbers.  The radius of the earth is Re  = 
2) Now we are going to ﬂy the trajectory backwards, taking advantage of the image theorem.  In  fact,  as  can  be  seen  in  the  sketch,  if  Vi  and  θ  are  chosen  correctly,  we will  generate  a  trajectory  that  is  the  mirror  image  of  the  return  trajectory.  If  we have  chosen  the  initial  conditions  properly–which  we  have  not–the  sum  of  these  two maneuvers  would  generate  a  free-return  trajectory  to  the  moon  with  a  launch  and  a later return to earth.  Our particular choice of θ and Vi  is unlikely to be correct, but it will be close. Essentially  repeat  the  steps  backwards  to  calculate  ΔVoutbound  which  when  added  to ΔVreturn, will give the ΔV mission for the entire mission.  It will be really, really big. 2-2a) Going backwards:  determine the ΔV  necessary increase the velocity of the space­craft from zero at the point B to the orbital speed of the Homan transfer orbit, ignoring the rotation of the earth and atmospheric drag. 2-2b) Now, determine and apply the ΔV  necessary to move from the elliptical orbit to the parking orbit Ro  = 3Re. 2-2c) Now determine the ΔVi  to launch onto the outbound trajectory. 2-2d) Determine the total ΔV  for the outbound mission.  What is the total ΔV  required for  the  outbound  mission?

5.  This problem is related to why the moon always shows the same side to the earth. Hint:  the interior mass distribution of the moon is extremely irregular.  Why does the moon always show the same side to the earth? Problem  4 (10 points)For countries in the high northern latitudes, a geostationary communications satellite is  not  an  attractive  option  because  of  the  long  distance  and  the  low  grazing  angle  of the communication signal.  The Russians developed an alternate satellite system using an  highly  oblique,  north-dwelling  orbit  called  a  molnyia  orbit.  Although  a  simple polar  orbit  could  be  used,  for  reason  of  communication  eﬀectiveness  and  stability  in the  presence  of  the  oblateness  of  the  earth,  an  angle  of  64  degrees  is  commonly  used for  molnyia  orbits.  The  orbit  is  highly  eccentric.  The  satellite  spends  most  of  its time  in  the  northern  hemisphere  at  low  speeds,  and  then  comes  close  to  the  earth  in the  southern  hemisphere  at  high  speeds,  spending  a  small  fraction  of  its  orbit  there. The  US  also  uses  this  orbit  for  optical  satellites  that  spend  most  of  their  time  in  the northern hemisphere–I wonder why? Determine  the  orbital  parameters  for  a  satellite  with  a  12  hour  period.  Ignore  the rotation  of  the  earth  and  the  motion  of  the  earth  around  the  sun.  In  this  case,  the satellite will retrace its orbit twice per day.  Two satellites will give reasonable coverage of the northern latitudes. The  additional  criteria  to  be  applied  to  ﬁx  the  orbit  parameters  is  that  the  satellite spends  70%  of  its  period  above  the  equator.  If  you  have  trouble  with  the  geometry, just work this out for a polar (vertical) orbit.  What is the semi-major axis of the orbit? How close does it come to the surface of the earth?  How far away does it get?  What is its eccentricity? For a non-rotating earth, sketch the trace of the satellite’s orbit, deﬁned as the points that  are  directly  below  the  satellite  at  various  times  in  its  orbit.  (Directly  below  is deﬁned as being on a line from the satellite to the center of the earth.)  Take the line from  the  equator  to  the  north  pole  through  Moscow  (located  at  latitude  @

2) a)  Using  MATLAB,  apply  the  transformation  matrix  generated  by  the  transformation  to  transform the  inertia  tensor/matrix  of  the  cube.  Show  that  the  axes  in  the  coordinate  system  x��, y��, z��  are principal axis.  What is the inertia tensor in this coordinate system?  What are the x��, y��, z��  vectors in terms of the original coordinate system x, y, z? b) Now apply the MATLAB eigenvalue process to the inertia matrix of the cube in the original x, y, z system.  This process results in the eigenvalues, which are the inertias about the 3 principal axes, and the vectors which constitute the principal axes.  Compare your results with those of part a). Since the 2 inertias in the plane perpendicular to the diagonal of the cube are equal, any axis in the plane  is  a  principal  axis.  Therefore  your  numerical  results  could  diﬀer  from  your  analytical  results but would produce two axis directions in the plane normal to the cube diagonal. c) Sketch your results in 3 dimensions, showing the cube in the x, y, z  coordinate system.

How are these principal axis oriented with respect to the body-ﬁxed x, y, z (roll, pitch, yaw) coordinate system?  What is the angle in degrees between the roll axis (x) and the nearest principal axis? b) For an angular velocity vector ω about the roll axis (x) only, what is the magnitude and direction of the angular momentum vector.  What are its components along the pitch, roll and yaw axes?  What angle is degrees does it make with the roll axis? c) On the ﬂight to the moon, it was necessary to rotate the vehicle about the roll axis to ensure even solar heating.

1. Celestial bodies move in three dimensions, so in general you would write your equations for the x, y,and z positions of each body.  However, for this lab, we will take the position of the earth, moon and spacecraft system and their motions as conﬁned to the x, y  plane.  Therefore, the z  equations are not required. For numerical purposes it is convenient to write the equation of motion r¨ = F /m for each body as a system of ﬁrst order equations.  That is, we write, r˙ = v, v˙ = F /m. (2a) (2b) Therefore, to describe the motion of a body in two dimensions, four state variables are required – two  for  position  and  two  for  velocity.  For  three  moving  bodies  conﬁned  to  planar  motion  in  the x, y plane,we need only four for each body for a total of twelve.  We will use a Cartesian coordinate system  which  means  that  the  equations  should  be  separated  into  Cartesian  x,and  y  components. The  state  vector  X  contains  all  variables  that  completely  describe  the  state  of  the  system.  For purposes of uniformity, you should order the states as follows, (

4.  Earth-Moon  Simulation-Rotating  Coordinates Now  program  the  equations  for  the  earth  moon  relative  motion  in  a  rotating  coordinate  system.

Turn  in  your derivation  of  these  governing  equations.  Now,  if  you  equations  are  correct,  you  should  be able to place the earth and the moon at their initial positions and see no motion:  i.e they will be ﬁxed  in  your  coordinate  system.  You  may  have  to  adjust  the  values  of  Ω  slightly  to  get  them  to stay absolutely ﬁxed in the rotating system; shouldn’t be a big adjustment. Turn in the value of Ω that leads to stationary positions of the earth and moon inthe rotating coordinate system.

3.  Behavior  About  Lagrange  Points Consider  two  masses  orbiting  one  another.  The  mathematician  Lagrange  showed  that  this  system  has  5 points of equilibrium.  This means that a third body located at one of these Lagrange points  will experience exactly the required acceleration to remain stationary in orbit relative to the other two bodies.  The ﬁgure sketches the relative positions of the 5 Lagrange points. 4 The exact locations of the Lagrange points depend on the mass ratio of the two planets, M/m.  For any mass ratio,  L1,  L2,  and  L3  are  unstable.  This  means  that  bodies  located  there  will  slowly  drift  away.  NASA’s SOHO  solar  observer  telescope  is  located  at  the  Sun-Earth  L1,  but  must  frequently  make  small  course corrections  to  stay  in  place.  For  mass  ratios  greater  than  about  25,  the  L4  and  L5  points  are  stable.  For instance,  the  Sun-Jupiter  L4  and  L5  points  contain  thousands  of  asteroids  called  the  Trojan  asteroids.  In Lecture 18, we showed that for small  α (α is the mass ratio between the two bodies;  α = Mmoon/Mearth), expressions could be obtained for the locations of the Lagrange points:  L1, L2  and L3  along the x axis. �1/3 � � α �1/3 � � α �1/3 � � 3 3 1 + 5α 12 XL1  =  R � � � XL3  =  −R XL2  =  R 1 − 1 + (

Use the Matlab function wavread to read the audio clip into Matlab. Be sure to capture all the outputs, as you will need these to properly play back the quantized version you will produce. You can play back a vector using the sound function. b)	 Create a function called quantize that will take as input the sound vector produced from wavread and the number of quantization levels, N, as a power of two (an input of 4 would be 2  quantization levels). For simplicity, implement a uniform quantizer with the region size, !, being evenly spaced across the range of the input sound and xi being assigned the middle of the region. 4c)  The quantizer function should return the following: a.

2.  A text editor These two items are all that you will need in order to write your first application.   Creating Your First Application Your first application, HelloWorldApp, will simply display the greeting "Hello world!"  To create this program, you will:   •  Create a source file A source file contains code written in the Java programming language, which you and other programmers can understand. You can use any text editor to create and edit source files.  Source files end with the extension .java. •  Compile the source file into an executable file The Java programming language compiler (javac) takes your (.java) source file and  translates  its  text  into  instructions  that  the  Java  virtual  machine  can understand (.class files). The instructions contained within this file are known as bytecodes.  Javac is passed the name of the .java file for the top-level class that implements the desired function.  •  Run the program The  Java  application launcher  tool (java)  uses  the  Java  virtual  machine  to  run your application.  Java is passed the name of the top-level class that implements the desired function.  Its corresponding .class file is loaded, and the main method of the corresponding method is invoked.  Note that the extension .class is not supplied.  Create a Source File First, start your text editor. In a new document, type in the following code: /**  * The HelloWorldApp class implements an application that  * simply prints "Hello World!" to standard output.  */ class HelloWorldApp {     public static void main(String[] args) {         System.out.println("Hello World!"); // Display the string.     } } Save the code in a file with the name HelloWorldApp.java.  The file needs to be saved in  plan  text  format;  it  cannot  contain  any  special  formatting  directives,  such  as  those saved by default by WYSIWYG editors like Word.  A commonly employed command-based editor is Gnu Emacs, a mature open source editor provided by the Free Software Foundation.  Compile the Source File into a .class File Bring up a command window (known as a shell on Unix). You can do this from the Start menu by choosing Command Prompt (Windows XP), or by choosing Run... and then entering cmd.  In Windows XP, by default Command Prompt can be found at Start> All Programs> Accessories>, while Run is found at Start>. To compile your source file, change your current directory to the directory where your file  is  located,  using  cd  <directory-name>.  You  can  list  the  contents  of  the  current directory, including subdirectories, using dir, You can move up a directory using “cd ..“ that is, by supplying double dot as the directory name.   At the prompt, type the following command and press Enter.  javac HelloWorldApp.java The compiler has generated a bytecode file, HelloWorldApp.class. Now that you have a .class file, you can run your program, as described below.  If you encounter problems with the instructions in this step, consult the Common Problems (and Their Solutions) at http://java.sun.com/docs/books/tutorial/getStarted/problems/index.html.   Run your HelloWorldApp Program In the same directory, enter the following command at the prompt:  java HelloWorldApp The next figure shows what you should now see:   If you encounter problems with the instructions in this step, consult the Common Problems (and Their Solutions) at http://java.sun.com/docs/books/tutorial/getStarted/cupojava/index.html.

1.  Depth-first 
2.  Breadth-first.  You will then experiment with these algorithms using the Battlecode platform.  You will install  and  familiarize  yourself  with  Battlecode,  which  will  be  used  in  some  other problem sets as well.  You  will  demonstrate  good  programming  style,  including  the  appropriate  use  of exceptions,  comments,  interfaces,  and  classes.    This  will  allows  the  teaching  staff  to assess your programming ability, coming into the course.  In addition, the second objective of this problem set is to develop your skill at performing an asymptotic analysis of uninformed search. Submission Instructions Please submit your source code [src] electronically. However, do NOT submit a collection of files. You must submit a single ZIP file containing all of the  source  files. Make  sure  to  comment  your  code  sufficiently  so  that  the  grader  can  easily  understand your  code.  No  partial  credit  can  be  given  if  the  code  cannot  be  understood.  Submit a single PDF [pdf] file containing all additional material such as execution traces and analysis. You must also submit a hard copy of the PDF file.  At  the  end  of  each  problem,  a  list  specifies  all  items  that  must  be  included  in  your submission. Each item that has [pdf] written next to it must be part of the PDF document, and not a separate file. As you complete your assignment, please include in your PDF document, at the end of each answer, how long you spent on it. Background Implement the following problems according to the lecture notes (2 and 
3.  Implement  depth-first  search,  which  extends  the  implementation  of  the  general uninformed search class by completing the implementation of the following method: protected void addToQueue(Set<Node> reachableNodes)   Remember  that  depth-first  search  adds  a  set  of  paths  to  the  front  of  the  search queue,  i.e.  the  search  queue  is  of  LIFO  type  or  a  stack.    For  example,  if  Q  = (A,B,C,D)  and  the  extended  paths  =  (E,F,G),  then  the  result  of  adding  the extended paths to Q should be (E,F,G,A,B,C,D).

1.  The limb movements cause the organism to move in the water and find new sources of food.  The very simple control mechanism  of  the  organism  has  been  modeled  by  the  biologist  as  a  Hidden  Markov Model (HMM), consisting of three states - a, b, and c - with probabilistic transitions as shown in the diagram below.  While the organism’s state is not directly observable, limb movement sequences (m1,t) can be observed and recorded from video tapes of the organism. The organism is always in state a when it has finished feeding, so that when it begins to move to a new location it is known to be in state ‘a’. After one such feeding period the following sequence of limb movements  is  recorded  “00101101”.  Use  the  Viterbi  algorithm  to  estimate  the  most likely sequence of states that the organism moved through for the given limb movement sequence.

1.  I am here ignoring the fact the we unfortunately do also permit mere “paper patents”; equating since at least the Bell Telephone Cases, the theoretical portraying of an idea in a patent  application  as  the  legal  “equivalent”  of  an  actual  reduction  to  practice  -  -  a lawyers’  I  think,  lousy  “invention”  of  the  purely  legalistic  concept  of  so-called “constructive reduction to practice” by filing a patent application.  I know, however, of no new companies or jobs that such legal machinations have produced, and fortunately the Courts give them very limited scope and importance in practice.   17 America’s Different Patent System: The Reason The U.S. Outperforms The World   It is to the rewarding of the completion of this special latter effort -- not stopping at mere conception -- that the American patent laws were specifically designed to encourage.  It is the making of real contributions to the progress of useful arts and the encouraging of risk-taking in the launching of new technologies, businesses, jobs and exports, that have been defining and still increasingly define America’s vastly superior performance over the rest of the world.  Not only does the real inventor demonstrate and test the prototype in private, but the inventor and backers have the further real-world necessity before risking capital, to receive feed-back as to the potential commercial viability of the prototype in the marketplace--questions such as can it compete favorably with what's out there; is it in the form that users want or need and indicate they will buy; what is the reaction at trade shows, etc.; does it need to be changed, modified or improved to make it actually commercially useful, and/or to meet the real practical requirements of potential customers, instead of those perceived or guessed-at by the inventor?  A patent, despite how foreigners may often look at it, is not just a piece of paper; it represents the real opportunity for entrepreneurship if properly granted and used.  America, unlike the rest of the world, has accordingly always recognized that there is absolutely no way to answer these questions without actual test marketing; and it has always been America's unique philosophy to encourage the inventor to perfect the invention for the marketplace and thus for the real benefit of the public; and not just to blindly proceed with the first crude idea and leap into the Patent Office.  18 America’s Different Patent System: The Reason The U.S. Outperforms The World   More than this, America, once more totally unlike the rest of the world, has deliberately and specifically tailored its laws to encourage the inventor not to jump into the Patent Office with the first crude or hasty approach; but, to the very contrary, diligently to refine the invention as initial market and public use experience dictates -- and then only to file in the Patent Office the most finished and "best mode" of realization of the invention as possible, though within statutory time constraints. Test Marketing Essentials  In order to achieve the benefit of this technological and economic necessity of feed-back that underpins the real world of invention development and marketing--and again as distinguished from foreign claim-jumping into the Patent Offices with rushed conceptions and/or first crude attempts, under penalty of losing all--our law not only provides for such a public use and marketing test period, but it provides such without penalty and with protection against stealth.  We protect the inventor's dates of actual invention during that period from those who would try to steal, or are stimulated themselves to file on "improvements" that may actually also be within the inventor's present contemplation and records, and that are ultimately to be presented in the inventor's patent application.  At inventors’ and engineering conferences over the past years, throughout the country, I have personally encountered tens of large company inventors who decry their inability to take advantage of America's legal understanding of these real needs of the innovation process, because their employers require adhering to the rules of the European and Japanese laws under which they heavily trade.  Though their legal departments deny us direct questionnaire  access to their inventors, my MIT students and I are accumulating  19 America’s Different Patent System: The Reason The U.S. Outperforms The World  their views -- painfully slowly -- by oral interviews and public meetings where their employers are not present.  I have yet, however, to meet my first large company inventor who is happy with half-baked patent applications his or her employers spew out with their army of patent lawyers and patent engineers, under the pressure of the "first-to-file"-"absolute novelty" system requirements.  As for university inventors, I have documented many academic inventors and colleagues, all over the country, who either ignore their institution’s efforts to force hasty application filing before they hold public seminars, demonstrations, or discussions with peers, or who just do not disclose their private developments until they are themselves satisfied with their testing and refining in light of feed-back from colleagues, including outside the institution.  They refuse largely to publish half-baked papers, and many regard 18-month publication of rushed patent applications to be in this category, and often even do not want their names or reputations associated with such.  At the numerous independent and small-business conferences that my wife Joanne on behalf of her Inventors’ Digest and I attend, we find that almost everyone has rejected the concept of living under the European and Japanese first-to-file, absolute novelty rules; and almost no one of that constituency now even files abroad, just because they do not perceive that it is worth it to them to lose the immunity from 18-month publication and the other protections and benefits of the current American system.  Having just returned from Japan, moreover, Joanne and I were amazed to learn from our Japanese patent associates, of their clients’ frustration in losing out, in what they estimated to be about 30% of the time, to first-to-file claim jumpers of inventions that they had been earlier diligently developing.    20 America’s Different Patent System: The Reason The U.S. Outperforms The World   Let us now examine the legal system that America invented and has most successfully time-tested, to match the needs of real-world innovation with complementary legal principles.  21 America’s Different Patent System: The Reason The U.S. Outperforms The World  Chapter 4 Our Legal System Predicated On The First To Invent, Not The First To Claim-Jump [Comparison With First-To-File Foreign Systems]   I have earlier described why I am convinced of the unconstitutionality of a legislative fiat that black is white; i.e. that the first to file is necessarily and immutably the first inventor.  Pursuant to over 200 years of Constitutional interpretation, the unanimous. decisions of all the Courts of this land, and the unanimous American definitions and interpretations of the word "inventor" (including by schoolchildren, as before stated), the Congress, the Patent Office and the Courts have operated under the following specially tailored laws and customs throughout our history -- and to the great benefit of our society and the world in general:      FIRST, for the integrity of our U.S.A: system, we require that the inventor:  A.  Personally and as an individual, must file and sign the patent application.  B.  The inventor must make a written oath or statutory declaration that the invention is "original" with the applicant, and that the applicant believes he or she is such original, true, and sole (or joint) inventor, - - all under pain and penalties of perjury, and all under the further consequence of a holding of invalidity of the application and any patent that may issue therefrom.  FOREIGN:  None of these requirements of   A, B, C or D in any first-to-file country.                   22 America’s Different Patent System: The Reason The U.S. Outperforms The World  Non-existent.  C.  The applicant must also represent (again under oath or declaration) the lack of knowledge of prior invention by others, or of publication or public use or prior patenting by anyone more than one year before filing.  D.  The applicant must acknowledge   in writing the duty to       disclose pertinent prior art       and activities and to                             acknowledge the inventor’s duty       of candor before the Patent          Office.                                             U.S.A:       SECOND, the patent applicant, as earlier mentioned, is afforded a period of one year from first public exposure of the invention -- public use, public disclosure, marketing, sale or offer for sale or lease, publication, or other public dissemination -- in which to file the U.S. patent application.  U.S.A:        THIRD, as an accompanying essential corollary to the one-year public disclosure provision, interference proceeding protection against copying, stealth or re-invention by others, or stimulation to file on the part of others who see the product on the market or hear a lecture or see a publication during the one-year public use period.    FOREIGN:  Non-existent. Even a single public exposure of any kind whatsoever before filing the application is a total bar to the patent – so-called “absolute novelty” - - i.e. knowledge publicly imparted in the country before application filing, no matter how trivially.   FOREIGN:  Non-existent.  They really do not care how the filer derived the "invention."  They require no information whatsoever, let alone an oath as to the origin of the invention.  Their bureaucracy has absolutely no concern with any inventors’ "rights."       Without this interference protection, the one-year public marketing or publication period, above, is only an invitation to copying, stealth, fraud, and the possible depriving of the inventor of improvement protection in contemplation.  [This is one of the reasons  23 America’s Different Patent System: The Reason The U.S. Outperforms The World  why Europe is still struggling with how to institute a so-called "grace period" that they now realize is essential in the face of their current admittedly inadequate first-to- file experience.] FOURTH, for those types of inventions that by their nature require a longer testing in public for proof of utility, we long ago evolved an experimental (not-for-profit), public use exception to the one-year rule -- again a recognition by our law of the needs of real-world technological development.  This started with a highway case where the determination of the utility and potential life of the road in actual public carriage use could not be determined within the statutory two-year period of public use that was then allowed before filing. FIFTH, a sophisticated      concern, under our Constitutional mandate of promoting the useful arts, for encouraging quality and commercial usefulness of invention, by affording reasonable time (with interference process protection) for diligent development and perfecting before filing the patent application -- in direct contradistinction to a race to the Patent Office.  This is entirely consonant and harmonious with the way engineering and academia actually do their real-world work. U.S.A:   U.S.A:   FOREIGN:  Non-existent. Totally blind and callous to the real needs of technological development.  Don't care.                 FOREIGN:   Non-existent.  Of absolutely no concern.  The race to the Patent Office is the end all.  24 America’s Different Patent System: The Reason The U.S. Outperforms The World  Our system makes it possible for academic and other researchers diligently to perfect their inventions in the normal processes of research and development, and not to be in danger of being totally wiped out by a new-comer’s quick and perhaps only theoretical filing. U.S.A:          SIXTH, as a corollary of the item immediately above, and in our encouragement of quality and utility, our system positively discourages the filing of sketchy, incomplete, half-baked, hurried disclosures by:        A. A legal requirement for a full and complete and clear disclosure and patent claiming, totally adequate for one skilled in the art to understand and practice the invention; and        B. A strict legal requirement even for teaching of the "best mode" of implementation of the invention known to the inventor.  FOREIGN:  No such requirements.          Much more sketchy and less detailed disclosures routinely accepted and indeed often inherent in the first-to-file world.  U.S. examiners considering such foreign applications when filed as a corresponding U.S. convention patent application counterpart, frequently reject them as incomplete, insufficient and inadequate disclosures under our law.  No apparent concern for the practice of multiple subsequent filings to try to bolster first-to-file applications hastily concocted on peril of foreclosure Our law is also calculated not only to avoid the necessity for multiple successive modification filings for bolstering the sufficiency of the originally conceived idea, but to discourage flooding the Patent Office with such supplementary improvement filings with the concurrent resulting adding to the backlog of the examining corps.  25 America’s Different Patent System: The Reason The U.S. Outperforms The World  FOREIGN:  No such considerations.   "Equity" is not in their lives.  The state does not allow for inadvertent mistakes or for the real-world fact that the full scope of the initial invention in its infancy is not always immediately self-evident.  U.S.A: SEVENTH, our law further recognizes the real-world difficulty in the early formulating of patent claims for new ideas and that must avoid world-wide prior art, but that still offer adequate and proper protection for what often only time will ultimately reveal more clearly as the proper scope of the invention.  Our system, accordingly, provides equitable remedies.  [England, that once had the genius to create "equity," has now in my view a genius-less generation which apparently has chosen to discard “equity” in deference to wearing the "same suit" as their neighbors on the Continent].   The U.S., more sensitively and understandingly, provides equitable remedies by way of reissue proceedings to correct real and honest errors in claim scope (broader or narrower); and re-examination proceedings for similar purposes including inadvertently over-claiming or under-claiming and also for public protection from the Patent Office inadvertently missing more pertinent prior art.  Our patent law (and, indeed, our law in all fields) conducts itself far differently from the literal formalistic strictness philosophy and conduct of Continental countries -- being rather postured in real substantative considerations not strictly form; indeed, with concern for balancing the equities of the inventor’s proper and adequate protection against the right of the public not to be penalized by an inventor’s initial mistaken  26 America’s Different Patent System: The Reason The U.S. Outperforms The World  claiming.  That said, our law recognizes the practical difficulties in using mere words (claims) adequately to describe very complex concepts, and from different points of view --and all at the inventor’s peril.  If the inventor inadvertently over claims [and who, in the beginning, can always be so clairvoyant as fully to appreciate the total scope of the infant invention], the Court will invalidate the patent.  If the inventor under claims, the world is free to get around and appropriate the invention.  And, of course, the inventor has the further burden of being charged legally with the actually impossible and mythical task of “knowing” everything that is known in the world. The strictly American philosophy of enabling reissue or re-examination to rescue correct claim scope, while protecting the rights of the public that relied on the original patent claims as issued, is another novel American doctrine pursuant to the Constitutional mandate that Congress, in furthering its charge to promote the progress of the useful arts, is instructed by the Constitution to do so by "securing" to inventors the "exclusive rights" to their "discoveries."           27 America’s Different Patent System: The Reason The U.S. Outperforms The World  Chapter Five  The Very Different Inventive Communities In The United States And Abroad   Pursuant to the climate created by the above at least seven American legal  provisions by which our legal system strives to aid and indeed match the real-world needs of invention, innovation and entrepreneurship in prosecuting patent applications in the Patent Office, these sophisticated, carefully crafted, proven, time-tested and honed legal provisions have enabled  America vastly to outperform and continue to outperform the whole world put together, by any measures one cares to define.  Our system has given rise to an extraordinary and unique community of independent inventors, largely absent elsewhere as earlier noted, and certainly absent in the relative size and importance of activity and innovation achieved by America's independent inventors.  The attempt by the Patent Office to measure the independent inventor community size by counting only the number of applications filed in personal names, as distinguished from those being shown as assigned to corporations, simply fails to appreciate the real world wherein today most individual inventors form their own infant corporations to which they assign their applications.  But even the 25 percent size acknowledged by the Patent Office “statistics,” perhaps even half again greater, does not reflect the modern story of America’s independent inventors and their small businesses that are responsible for much of the break-through inventions and a disproportionate share of the more significant inventions.   28 America’s Different Patent System: The Reason The U.S. Outperforms The World  They truly still follow the same tradition as their independent inventor forebears, such as Fulton, Whitney, Edison, Bell, the Wright brothers and our other old folk heroes.  Today and in the recent past, while their names may not be household words, the contributions of the independent inventors (not the large corporations) include the ATM, the World-Wide Web, the implantable pacemaker, the MRI, the laser, the Apple computer, the PC-DOS computer operating system, the digital compact disc, the disposable diaper, Gore-tex fabric, the jet ski, the snowboard, the supercomputer, the "Walkman,” the electronic calculator, "Power Bars,” and quite recently, the interesting "Segway" scooter, to mention but a very few.  In recognition of this prodigious performance, our Patent Office, and to my understanding no other Patent Office in the world, has developed a special office for independent inventors in recognition of their special needs.  Included in this important independent and small business inventive community, moreover, is the university inventor community -- particularly those who also entrepreneur their own new businesses spun off from their academic activities--also a largely American phenomenon, and certainly in the large extent that we have developed.  And it is these strictly American phenomena that feed the large corporations with new technological thrusts and that refurbish and grow the large companies and indeed keep them surviving, as they buy-up the entrepreneurial developments of the small innovative enterprises launched on the backs of independent invention, and then contribute their talent in mass production and world-wide marketing.  Really, in this invention arena, the only thing that America has in common with the rest of the world is their large multi-national corporations.  They today must live  29 America’s Different Patent System: The Reason The U.S. Outperforms The World  abroad under the rules of foreign patent systems.  While they understandingly accordingly urge one universal set of harmonious rules for patent application filings and prosecution for their comfort, this would grievously be inimical to the different needs of America's independent, small-business, academic inventive and entrepreneurial communities who both historically and presently thrive under our very different American rules.   It should be noted, moreover, that the large corporations have also their economic might and muscle to compete, and now generally, perhaps with the exception of pharmaceuticals and the like, do not today belabor the “exclusive” feature of the patents; whereas the independent, small business and academic communities only have the exclusive patent rights as their protection to compete and, indeed, even get started.   30 America’s Different Patent System: The Reason The U.S. Outperforms The World   Chapter Six The Large Corporate And Some Bureaucratic Whining For "Harmonization"   Let us examine some of the "rationale" for so-called "harmonization" that we hear advanced by the "big boys,” remembering that by "harmonization,” they mean we jettison our system and adopt foreign laws -- not that the world adopts the best of theirs and the best of ours: 
2. The first-to-invent philosophy is out of step with the rest of the world. In the interest of uniformity, we should have one universal set of patent laws. 
3. The protections required for first-to-invent, including interference practice to determine the real first inventor in the event of overlapping or interfering applications, is too costly, and time-consuming, and is only for the benefit of a tiny percentage of patent applicants; being further an inordinate burden on the Patent Office. 
4. The "first-to-file" system economically solves all these “problems.” Let's discuss these points. 
1.  I am here ignoring the fact the we unfortunately do also permit mere “paper patents”; equating since at least the Bell Telephone Cases, the theoretical portraying of an idea in a patent  application  as  the  legal  “equivalent”  of  an  actual  reduction  to  practice  -  -  a lawyers’  I  think,  lousy  “invention”  of  the  purely  legalistic  concept  of  so-called “constructive reduction to practice” by filing a patent application.  I know, however, of no new companies or jobs that such legal machinations have produced, and fortunately the Courts give them very limited scope and importance in practice.   17 America’s Different Patent System: The Reason The U.S. Outperforms The World   It is to the rewarding of the completion of this special latter effort -- not stopping at mere conception -- that the American patent laws were specifically designed to encourage.  It is the making of real contributions to the progress of useful arts and the encouraging of risk-taking in the launching of new technologies, businesses, jobs and exports, that have been defining and still increasingly define America’s vastly superior performance over the rest of the world.  Not only does the real inventor demonstrate and test the prototype in private, but the inventor and backers have the further real-world necessity before risking capital, to receive feed-back as to the potential commercial viability of the prototype in the marketplace--questions such as can it compete favorably with what's out there; is it in the form that users want or need and indicate they will buy; what is the reaction at trade shows, etc.; does it need to be changed, modified or improved to make it actually commercially useful, and/or to meet the real practical requirements of potential customers, instead of those perceived or guessed-at by the inventor?  A patent, despite how foreigners may often look at it, is not just a piece of paper; it represents the real opportunity for entrepreneurship if properly granted and used.  America, unlike the rest of the world, has accordingly always recognized that there is absolutely no way to answer these questions without actual test marketing; and it has always been America's unique philosophy to encourage the inventor to perfect the invention for the marketplace and thus for the real benefit of the public; and not just to blindly proceed with the first crude idea and leap into the Patent Office.  18 America’s Different Patent System: The Reason The U.S. Outperforms The World   More than this, America, once more totally unlike the rest of the world, has deliberately and specifically tailored its laws to encourage the inventor not to jump into the Patent Office with the first crude or hasty approach; but, to the very contrary, diligently to refine the invention as initial market and public use experience dictates -- and then only to file in the Patent Office the most finished and "best mode" of realization of the invention as possible, though within statutory time constraints. Test Marketing Essentials  In order to achieve the benefit of this technological and economic necessity of feed-back that underpins the real world of invention development and marketing--and again as distinguished from foreign claim-jumping into the Patent Offices with rushed conceptions and/or first crude attempts, under penalty of losing all--our law not only provides for such a public use and marketing test period, but it provides such without penalty and with protection against stealth.  We protect the inventor's dates of actual invention during that period from those who would try to steal, or are stimulated themselves to file on "improvements" that may actually also be within the inventor's present contemplation and records, and that are ultimately to be presented in the inventor's patent application.  At inventors’ and engineering conferences over the past years, throughout the country, I have personally encountered tens of large company inventors who decry their inability to take advantage of America's legal understanding of these real needs of the innovation process, because their employers require adhering to the rules of the European and Japanese laws under which they heavily trade.  Though their legal departments deny us direct questionnaire  access to their inventors, my MIT students and I are accumulating  19 America’s Different Patent System: The Reason The U.S. Outperforms The World  their views -- painfully slowly -- by oral interviews and public meetings where their employers are not present.  I have yet, however, to meet my first large company inventor who is happy with half-baked patent applications his or her employers spew out with their army of patent lawyers and patent engineers, under the pressure of the "first-to-file"-"absolute novelty" system requirements.  As for university inventors, I have documented many academic inventors and colleagues, all over the country, who either ignore their institution’s efforts to force hasty application filing before they hold public seminars, demonstrations, or discussions with peers, or who just do not disclose their private developments until they are themselves satisfied with their testing and refining in light of feed-back from colleagues, including outside the institution.  They refuse largely to publish half-baked papers, and many regard 18-month publication of rushed patent applications to be in this category, and often even do not want their names or reputations associated with such.  At the numerous independent and small-business conferences that my wife Joanne on behalf of her Inventors’ Digest and I attend, we find that almost everyone has rejected the concept of living under the European and Japanese first-to-file, absolute novelty rules; and almost no one of that constituency now even files abroad, just because they do not perceive that it is worth it to them to lose the immunity from 18-month publication and the other protections and benefits of the current American system.  Having just returned from Japan, moreover, Joanne and I were amazed to learn from our Japanese patent associates, of their clients’ frustration in losing out, in what they estimated to be about 30% of the time, to first-to-file claim jumpers of inventions that they had been earlier diligently developing.    20 America’s Different Patent System: The Reason The U.S. Outperforms The World   Let us now examine the legal system that America invented and has most successfully time-tested, to match the needs of real-world innovation with complementary legal principles.  21 America’s Different Patent System: The Reason The U.S. Outperforms The World  Chapter 4 Our Legal System Predicated On The First To Invent, Not The First To Claim-Jump [Comparison With First-To-File Foreign Systems]   I have earlier described why I am convinced of the unconstitutionality of a legislative fiat that black is white; i.e. that the first to file is necessarily and immutably the first inventor.  Pursuant to over 200 years of Constitutional interpretation, the unanimous. decisions of all the Courts of this land, and the unanimous American definitions and interpretations of the word "inventor" (including by schoolchildren, as before stated), the Congress, the Patent Office and the Courts have operated under the following specially tailored laws and customs throughout our history -- and to the great benefit of our society and the world in general:      FIRST, for the integrity of our U.S.A: system, we require that the inventor:  A.  Personally and as an individual, must file and sign the patent application.  B.  The inventor must make a written oath or statutory declaration that the invention is "original" with the applicant, and that the applicant believes he or she is such original, true, and sole (or joint) inventor, - - all under pain and penalties of perjury, and all under the further consequence of a holding of invalidity of the application and any patent that may issue therefrom.  FOREIGN:  None of these requirements of   A, B, C or D in any first-to-file country.                   22 America’s Different Patent System: The Reason The U.S. Outperforms The World  Non-existent.  C.  The applicant must also represent (again under oath or declaration) the lack of knowledge of prior invention by others, or of publication or public use or prior patenting by anyone more than one year before filing.  D.  The applicant must acknowledge   in writing the duty to       disclose pertinent prior art       and activities and to                             acknowledge the inventor’s duty       of candor before the Patent          Office.                                             U.S.A:       SECOND, the patent applicant, as earlier mentioned, is afforded a period of one year from first public exposure of the invention -- public use, public disclosure, marketing, sale or offer for sale or lease, publication, or other public dissemination -- in which to file the U.S. patent application.  U.S.A:        THIRD, as an accompanying essential corollary to the one-year public disclosure provision, interference proceeding protection against copying, stealth or re-invention by others, or stimulation to file on the part of others who see the product on the market or hear a lecture or see a publication during the one-year public use period.    FOREIGN:  Non-existent. Even a single public exposure of any kind whatsoever before filing the application is a total bar to the patent – so-called “absolute novelty” - - i.e. knowledge publicly imparted in the country before application filing, no matter how trivially.   FOREIGN:  Non-existent.  They really do not care how the filer derived the "invention."  They require no information whatsoever, let alone an oath as to the origin of the invention.  Their bureaucracy has absolutely no concern with any inventors’ "rights."       Without this interference protection, the one-year public marketing or publication period, above, is only an invitation to copying, stealth, fraud, and the possible depriving of the inventor of improvement protection in contemplation.  [This is one of the reasons  23 America’s Different Patent System: The Reason The U.S. Outperforms The World  why Europe is still struggling with how to institute a so-called "grace period" that they now realize is essential in the face of their current admittedly inadequate first-to- file experience.] FOURTH, for those types of inventions that by their nature require a longer testing in public for proof of utility, we long ago evolved an experimental (not-for-profit), public use exception to the one-year rule -- again a recognition by our law of the needs of real-world technological development.  This started with a highway case where the determination of the utility and potential life of the road in actual public carriage use could not be determined within the statutory two-year period of public use that was then allowed before filing. FIFTH, a sophisticated      concern, under our Constitutional mandate of promoting the useful arts, for encouraging quality and commercial usefulness of invention, by affording reasonable time (with interference process protection) for diligent development and perfecting before filing the patent application -- in direct contradistinction to a race to the Patent Office.  This is entirely consonant and harmonious with the way engineering and academia actually do their real-world work. U.S.A:   U.S.A:   FOREIGN:  Non-existent. Totally blind and callous to the real needs of technological development.  Don't care.                 FOREIGN:   Non-existent.  Of absolutely no concern.  The race to the Patent Office is the end all.  24 America’s Different Patent System: The Reason The U.S. Outperforms The World  Our system makes it possible for academic and other researchers diligently to perfect their inventions in the normal processes of research and development, and not to be in danger of being totally wiped out by a new-comer’s quick and perhaps only theoretical filing. U.S.A:          SIXTH, as a corollary of the item immediately above, and in our encouragement of quality and utility, our system positively discourages the filing of sketchy, incomplete, half-baked, hurried disclosures by:        A. A legal requirement for a full and complete and clear disclosure and patent claiming, totally adequate for one skilled in the art to understand and practice the invention; and        B. A strict legal requirement even for teaching of the "best mode" of implementation of the invention known to the inventor.  FOREIGN:  No such requirements.          Much more sketchy and less detailed disclosures routinely accepted and indeed often inherent in the first-to-file world.  U.S. examiners considering such foreign applications when filed as a corresponding U.S. convention patent application counterpart, frequently reject them as incomplete, insufficient and inadequate disclosures under our law.  No apparent concern for the practice of multiple subsequent filings to try to bolster first-to-file applications hastily concocted on peril of foreclosure Our law is also calculated not only to avoid the necessity for multiple successive modification filings for bolstering the sufficiency of the originally conceived idea, but to discourage flooding the Patent Office with such supplementary improvement filings with the concurrent resulting adding to the backlog of the examining corps.  25 America’s Different Patent System: The Reason The U.S. Outperforms The World  FOREIGN:  No such considerations.   "Equity" is not in their lives.  The state does not allow for inadvertent mistakes or for the real-world fact that the full scope of the initial invention in its infancy is not always immediately self-evident.  U.S.A: SEVENTH, our law further recognizes the real-world difficulty in the early formulating of patent claims for new ideas and that must avoid world-wide prior art, but that still offer adequate and proper protection for what often only time will ultimately reveal more clearly as the proper scope of the invention.  Our system, accordingly, provides equitable remedies.  [England, that once had the genius to create "equity," has now in my view a genius-less generation which apparently has chosen to discard “equity” in deference to wearing the "same suit" as their neighbors on the Continent].   The U.S., more sensitively and understandingly, provides equitable remedies by way of reissue proceedings to correct real and honest errors in claim scope (broader or narrower); and re-examination proceedings for similar purposes including inadvertently over-claiming or under-claiming and also for public protection from the Patent Office inadvertently missing more pertinent prior art.  Our patent law (and, indeed, our law in all fields) conducts itself far differently from the literal formalistic strictness philosophy and conduct of Continental countries -- being rather postured in real substantative considerations not strictly form; indeed, with concern for balancing the equities of the inventor’s proper and adequate protection against the right of the public not to be penalized by an inventor’s initial mistaken  26 America’s Different Patent System: The Reason The U.S. Outperforms The World  claiming.  That said, our law recognizes the practical difficulties in using mere words (claims) adequately to describe very complex concepts, and from different points of view --and all at the inventor’s peril.  If the inventor inadvertently over claims [and who, in the beginning, can always be so clairvoyant as fully to appreciate the total scope of the infant invention], the Court will invalidate the patent.  If the inventor under claims, the world is free to get around and appropriate the invention.  And, of course, the inventor has the further burden of being charged legally with the actually impossible and mythical task of “knowing” everything that is known in the world. The strictly American philosophy of enabling reissue or re-examination to rescue correct claim scope, while protecting the rights of the public that relied on the original patent claims as issued, is another novel American doctrine pursuant to the Constitutional mandate that Congress, in furthering its charge to promote the progress of the useful arts, is instructed by the Constitution to do so by "securing" to inventors the "exclusive rights" to their "discoveries."           27 America’s Different Patent System: The Reason The U.S. Outperforms The World  Chapter Five  The Very Different Inventive Communities In The United States And Abroad   Pursuant to the climate created by the above at least seven American legal  provisions by which our legal system strives to aid and indeed match the real-world needs of invention, innovation and entrepreneurship in prosecuting patent applications in the Patent Office, these sophisticated, carefully crafted, proven, time-tested and honed legal provisions have enabled  America vastly to outperform and continue to outperform the whole world put together, by any measures one cares to define.  Our system has given rise to an extraordinary and unique community of independent inventors, largely absent elsewhere as earlier noted, and certainly absent in the relative size and importance of activity and innovation achieved by America's independent inventors.  The attempt by the Patent Office to measure the independent inventor community size by counting only the number of applications filed in personal names, as distinguished from those being shown as assigned to corporations, simply fails to appreciate the real world wherein today most individual inventors form their own infant corporations to which they assign their applications.  But even the 25 percent size acknowledged by the Patent Office “statistics,” perhaps even half again greater, does not reflect the modern story of America’s independent inventors and their small businesses that are responsible for much of the break-through inventions and a disproportionate share of the more significant inventions.   28 America’s Different Patent System: The Reason The U.S. Outperforms The World  They truly still follow the same tradition as their independent inventor forebears, such as Fulton, Whitney, Edison, Bell, the Wright brothers and our other old folk heroes.  Today and in the recent past, while their names may not be household words, the contributions of the independent inventors (not the large corporations) include the ATM, the World-Wide Web, the implantable pacemaker, the MRI, the laser, the Apple computer, the PC-DOS computer operating system, the digital compact disc, the disposable diaper, Gore-tex fabric, the jet ski, the snowboard, the supercomputer, the "Walkman,” the electronic calculator, "Power Bars,” and quite recently, the interesting "Segway" scooter, to mention but a very few.  In recognition of this prodigious performance, our Patent Office, and to my understanding no other Patent Office in the world, has developed a special office for independent inventors in recognition of their special needs.  Included in this important independent and small business inventive community, moreover, is the university inventor community -- particularly those who also entrepreneur their own new businesses spun off from their academic activities--also a largely American phenomenon, and certainly in the large extent that we have developed.  And it is these strictly American phenomena that feed the large corporations with new technological thrusts and that refurbish and grow the large companies and indeed keep them surviving, as they buy-up the entrepreneurial developments of the small innovative enterprises launched on the backs of independent invention, and then contribute their talent in mass production and world-wide marketing.  Really, in this invention arena, the only thing that America has in common with the rest of the world is their large multi-national corporations.  They today must live  29 America’s Different Patent System: The Reason The U.S. Outperforms The World  abroad under the rules of foreign patent systems.  While they understandingly accordingly urge one universal set of harmonious rules for patent application filings and prosecution for their comfort, this would grievously be inimical to the different needs of America's independent, small-business, academic inventive and entrepreneurial communities who both historically and presently thrive under our very different American rules.   It should be noted, moreover, that the large corporations have also their economic might and muscle to compete, and now generally, perhaps with the exception of pharmaceuticals and the like, do not today belabor the “exclusive” feature of the patents; whereas the independent, small business and academic communities only have the exclusive patent rights as their protection to compete and, indeed, even get started.   30 America’s Different Patent System: The Reason The U.S. Outperforms The World   Chapter Six The Large Corporate And Some Bureaucratic Whining For "Harmonization"   Let us examine some of the "rationale" for so-called "harmonization" that we hear advanced by the "big boys,” remembering that by "harmonization,” they mean we jettison our system and adopt foreign laws -- not that the world adopts the best of theirs and the best of ours:

Consider the optimum location for the installation in the US, average yearly irradiance, sun incidence angle and effective coverage area, etc…  c) How large of an area of solar panels would be necessary to power a mid-sized sedan?

Is there a breakeven point between the proportion of renewables to coal at which ICE vehicles become “cleaner” than electric vehicles in terms of carbon dioxide emissions? Where in the country might this make a difference? Assume that the average electric vehicle consumes 350 Wh/mile and come up with reasonable values for all other numbers.  2MIT OpenCourseWarehttp://ocw.mit.edu

1.  (10 points) Assume that you wanted to achieve the same power output (400 horsepower), but with an engine of the same displacement that can only spin up to 4,000RPM. By what factor would the mean effective cylinder pressure have to increase over the values in this gasoline engine, which develops 400HP at 6,000RPM? Name two methods that are commonly used to achieve this. Solution P = (pmep * Vd *N)/nc For the 4,000RPM engine to produce the same horsepower as the 6,000RPM engine, its mean effective pressure (at 4,000RPM) would have to rise by (6,000/4,
2.  (10 points) Assume that the car whose torque/power curve is shown above requires 40horsepower to maintain 60mph. At which RPM does this engine most efficiently produce 40 horsepower? How would you design the transmission’s gear ratios to achieve best fuel economy on the highway? Solution 1,500 RPM, because this is the point where the throttle is opened the furthest (reducing pumping losses) and the RPM is the lowest (reducing friction losses) for the given power output. (+5 points) 5,000 RPM would be the most efficient operating point if this engine was being used at full capacity. The optimum efficiency is had when the engine’s throttle is as far open as possible, producing exactly the amount of power required by the vehicle at that speed (engine turning as slow as possible) (+5 points)     2Question 2: Electric Motors (20 points) 
3)  What are the primary energy efficiency advantage(s) of modern trains over road vehicle mass transport options like city busses or long-haul trucks (circle all that apply)  A) Lower Rolling Resistance B) Lower Aerodynamic Drag C) Fewer losses due to inertial acceleration D) Higher Power Plant Efficiency E) None of the Above    
4)  What is a fundamental limiting factor to a propeller’s speed in water?  Cavitation       5
5)  The large, slow-spinning diesel engines on container ships can achieve efficiencies greater than 45%. Cite one reason that aids in raising this efficiency figure.  Higher compression ratio  Extremely long stroke / expansion ratio Waste heat recovery systems   
6)  What is the point of supercharging a vehicle, and how does this work?  Increasing the specific power output (volumetric). By forcing more air into the engine, increasing the amount of oxygen available for combustion (which is complemented with additional fuel), increasing the mean effective pressure and torque output.      
7)  How does variable valve timing work to improve engine efficiency for a vehicle that’s driving in the city, where the engine RPM fluctuates during driving?  By widening the “sweet spot” of the engine by reducing pumping losses at the valvetrain and increasing torque output at those RPMS.      
8)  Why do the number of gears in automatic transmissions on newer cars keep increasing? In the ’60’s, automatic transmissions typically had 3 speeds, now most have at least 
9)  What is a fundamental advantage of fuel over batteries that allow it to achieve such high gravimetric (by mass) energy density?  They have the other half of the “fuel” available in the atmosphere (oxygen). This is not counted in computing the energy density values.

11) Name 4 logistic concerns that arise upon unloading different ships carrying different cargo at a port.  different ships unloading different types of cargo, that needs to be a.  Handled differently (bulk goods vs. containerized) b.  Inspected / run through customs differently c.  Prioritized differently d.  Sent through different distribution routes (pipelines vs. trains vs. trucks, etc…)       7
12) A guy at the auto parts store is trying to sell you a huge wing for your Honda Civic that looks like this.  Why is it a bad idea to put this on a front-wheel-drive car?  Commonly seen in rear-wheel drive race cars, wings serve to add downforce that increases traction in cornering at high speed. Adding downforce to the rear of a front-wheel drive car only serves to increase drag (you’d want downforce on the front wheels in this scenario) 
13) (Vehicle Dynamics). What is a fundamental advantage that allows a rear-wheel drive car to more quickly off the starting line in a drag race? Upon acceleration, the weight distribution shifts from the front to the rear. This puts more weight on the rear tires, allowing them to grip better and avoid slipping on initial acceleration.  Reference: Material:, Table 
1)  Knowing that the top speed a 200-horsepower (150kW) Jet Ski can reach is 65 mph, calculate the drag force on its hull. Assume that the jet-pump is 90% efficient in converting engine power to thrust. (1 mph = 
2)  Knowing that the diameter of the jet pump outlet is about 5 inches (.12 meters), calculate the velocity of the water coming out of the jet. 
3)  If you wanted to go 90 mph in this jet ski, how much power would you need the engine to  produce? Reference Image: Jet Skier (Fig. 
4)  Imagine that you instead used the pump from the jetski to force water through a hose and build yourself a water jet-pack (yes, they exist). This is simply a jet-ski pump sitting in a boat that gets dragged behind the rider by the hose.  A)  Do you believe that this vehicle will be able to achieve a higher lateral speed than the jetski for a pump of the same power output? Explain. B)  Name 3 important characteristics for sizing the nozzles of this device in order to optimize it for highest lateral speed. 2Question 2: Aircraft Aerodynamics (25 points) A small commercial airplane weighing 20,000 lbs flies at a cruising altitude of 33,000 feet.

1)  State the four component laws (tip: they relate current, voltage, resistance, power, capacitance, and inductance). 
2)  For each of the four laws, provide an explanation of how you would explain these laws to make them intuitive (please use your own analogies if you have any different from the ones we used in class): a)  How would you interpret resistor networks intuitively? b)  How do capacitors behave under constant voltage and during transitions? c)  How do inductors behave under constant current and during transitions? 
3)  During lecture it was stated multiple times that these laws are for “ideal” components. Describe using words and/or diagrams what are the non-ideal features of a real resistor, capacitor, and inductor. 
4)  These four laws require that you know two other laws to determine how a circuit behaves: Kirchoff’s current (KCL) and voltage (KVL) laws.  State these two laws and explain them using both words and diagrams. Problem 2 – Discrete Components

1) A half-wave rectifier looks like this: T1 4 AC+ AC-D 5 8 TRANSFORMER C RL Explain using a diagram that compares the input voltage (AC+/-) and the output voltage (V across RL) why it is a half wave.  The following steps could be useful: a) Assume the capacitor C is not there: i) how does the current flow across RL when the AC is on the positive side? ii) how does the current flow across RL when the AC is on the negative side? b) Add the capacitor and show the approximate signal 
2) Another way to implement a full wave rectifier is as follows (note it is not a bridge): D T 1 4 AC+ AC-5 6 8 TRANSFORMER CT D C RL This is a great way to understand the concept that voltages are relative and at the same time how transformers can help us: a) Since pin 6 is defined as ground, what is the AC polarity of pins 5 & 8? How about the DC polarity (after the diodes) of pins 5 & 8? b) Ignoring the capacitor, show how the current flows when the AC voltage is c) Draw a picture of the output voltage before the capacitor, and compare it to positive and negative the input voltage d) What happens when you account for the capacitor? e) Extra credit: what is the main difference in the output voltage between a bridge rectifier (from lecture) and a center-tap rectifier? Problem 2 – Regulators After reducing the voltage with a transformer and rectifying any AC signals, you practically always want to use a regulator. Lets makes sure you understand the benefits and caveats of both linear and switching regulators.

1.  Students are challenged. This is probably a gross understatement, but thanks to the filtering process MIT can set the bar higher, compared  to  other  universities,  as  far  as  the  challenge  associated  for  schoolwork.  Of  course,  it  will always be the case that some will find the schoolwork more challenging than others, but overall the bar is set quite high. Even if not all students are able to excel at said challenges, the experience earned from attempting  them  is  probably  greater  than  that  gained  from,  say,  successfully  completing  basic challenges. The flipside is that sometimes some students might be unprepared for said challenges and would crash and burn, however, this isn’t necessarily the case, which brings me to my second point. 
2.  There are tons of resources available to students. Even  if  you  happen  to  be  having  a  hard  time  with  classes,  there  are  just  TONS  of  resources  made available to students to get help. Many classes offer recitation, office hours and tutoring, on top of that you can find  past test,  homeworks  and  lectures  on OCW.  There  is  also Seminar  XL  which  is  a  seminar targeted at minorities which is basically a small group that meets a few times a week to go over material with  a  TA,  which  allows  for  a  more  one-on-one  interaction  than  in  recitation.  There  is  also  ESG  and Concourse  which  are  a  great  resource  as  they  accommodate  for  the  needs  of  students  for  different learning styles.  If you need to find even more resources then MIT has S3  which is a godsend. Overall, if you  need  help  you  can  find  help  and  people  are  more  than  happy  to  help  you  out  if  you  ask.  I  don’t know to what extent this is true in other universities, but at least in MIT I find the amount of help you can get to be at an excellent level. On  top  of  the  help  resources,  there  are  plenty  of  other  resources  at  an  academic  level,  such  as  class equipment.  Basically,  there  is  plenty  of  cool,  high  end  lab  equipment  you  can  play  with  to  aid  your learning, as well as various shops in case you need to build something, as well as a bunch of software made available to students at either low to no cost for them to use. 
3.  There are plenty of opportunities available. On  top  of  the  large  variety  of  academic  opportunities  given  to  students  through  the  large  variety  of courses, there are many opportunities available as far as gaining practical experience in just about any subject of choice. UROPs are quite plentiful, as well other job opportunities, for example F/ASIP or UPOP for internships. As far as research goes, I believe MIT has far more opportunities available to students than in many other institutions. There are also a variety of clubs in diverse subjects in which you can get practical experience, even if not necessarily academically oriented. 
4.  The education is well rounded. Students probably have a love-hate relationship with this point, but I personally find it to be good. At MIT students have to take courses not just in their major but in various other areas to fulfill GIRs. You actually have just about as many GIRs as you will end up having classes in your major. This ensures a well rounded education that will prepare students for a variety of challenges. People have about three to five careers in their life, and while it is certainly valuable to have technical knowledge in one specific field, it is good to have knowledge spread around various fields to ensure preparedness for other areas. I also find the need for a PE requirement to be a sound one. It isn’t so much at an academic education basis but rather a character development basis. Forcing students to exercise is a good thing. Those who complain  about  it  are  probably  the  ones  who  need  it  the  most.  For  those  who  like  sports,  there  are plenty of varsity/club sports at MIT in which students can take part in. 
5.  The educational style is quite unique. At MIT, I find that education rather than just being focused on transferring knowledge, it focuses more on teaching students  how  to  learn.  This  works  alongside  the variety of  learning resources  available  to students. It is usually the case that you won’t learn all you need to in class alone and will need to consult external resources, and it is up to you to see which resources are at your disposition and choose those which will work out the best for you. By the time you graduate, if someone handed you a syllabus and a book,  I’m  sure  you  would  be  able  to  figure  out  all  you  need  to  for  a  subject  by  yourself,  one  way  or another. 
6.  There is a strong learning-oriented community. A large part of what really makes MIT unique is its community. MIT does a great job in admissions by ensuring that particular characteristics are shared amongst students that will allow them to fit into the community. Not just intellectual characteristics, but also personality-wise. Not that all MIT students are similar by a long shot, but there are certain traits that allow them to “belong” to the community at MIT. This  community  promotes  intellectual  growth,  cooperation  and  provides  comfort  in  knowing  that  you can relate to your peers. Frankly, I think MIT is doing a great job as far as education goes. I might be slightly biased by the fact that I don’t really have a large basis for comparison. As a foreigner if find MIT to simply be eons ahead of any given university back home, and overall to just be far ahead from any other university I can think of. But only time will tell, I guess. It’s still too early for me to really make a properly informed evaluation of the education here. The honeymoon will be over at some point. Specific questions: Where do you want your education to take you? What do you think it should give you? How do you think MIT will help you achieve these goals? Where do you want your education to take you? After  graduating,  I  hope  to  be  able  to  find  a  job  in  the  field  of  EECS,  and  with  time  move  up  to  a management position. I can’t think of any specifics regarding what in the field of EECS I want to do just yet, seeing as I haven’t explored the field enough to have a specific idea. What do you think it should give you?

Moreover,  since  he  discontinuities  of  z12  result  from  three  causes: discontinuities of z1(� ) before �  = t, discontinuities of z2  between �  = t and �  = →, and the inequality between z1[t] and z1(t), condition (

1)  First,  in  order  for  the  closed  loop  system  to  be  stable,  the  transfer  function from  (  w w )T to  (  y u  )T  has  to  be  stable.  The  transfer  function  from  w1  to  y  is  given  by (I − P K)−1P  and is called system response function.  The transfer function from w1  to u is given by  (I − KP )−1  and  is  called  input  sensitivity  function.  The  transfer  function  from  w2  to  y  is (I − P K)−1P K  and  is  called  the  complementary  sensitivity  function.  The  transfer  function  from w to u is given by (I − KP )−12 ��  �yu =K.  Therefore, we have the following :  (I + P K)−1P (I + KP )−1(I + P K)−1P K (I + KP )−1K w1 w2 ��� . So, if K  is given as then K = Q(I − P Q)−1 = (I − QP )−1Q,  (I + P K)−1P	 = (I + P Q(I − P Q)−

1. Knowledge Representation. Clearly the agent will require mechanisms for representing the behavior rules it has learned, but the main applications of well-developed representational schemes will lie in effectively managing the input data from its environment. A hierarchical ontology, likely containing several specialized elements, will be required to abstract visual and other sensory stimuli to a level providing appropriate inputs to decision algorithms. Due to the complexity of these elements of the system, I plan to avoid the complexities of real-world knowledge representation and develop decision algorithms based on data from "toy" examples. Thomas Coffee 
2. Statistical Learning. The agent must be able to observe the behaviors of a human operator in an environment and develop decision strategies based on patterns extracted from this sample data. The agent must also be able to dynamically incorporate new sample data during its operations and incorporate new inferences into its strategic model. The complexity of the model should be optimally adjusted to the volume of training data available, and should be independently controllable by the method based on resource constraints. 
3.  Probabilistic  Reasoning.  While  arguably a  component  of  statistical  learning,  I  regard  the  agent's  actual  decision procedures as a somewhat distinct element of the system, which may be handled independently from the formulation of those procedures based on learning. The execution of these decision procedures will almost certainly require probabilistic inference, although the specific methods involved will depend upon the strategies produced by the learning framework. Part C: Making Your Cognitive Robot I regard statistical learning as the most fundamental element of the system described above, and most worthy of further investigation:  by  comparison,  knowledge  representations  are  more  specific  and  complex,  and  probabilistic  reasoning methods are better understood. This agent would ideally be able to perform uninformed pattern recognition— that is, without the aid of pre-defined model hypotheses— on behaviors exhibited by humans based on compatible input data streams. While the system may rely initially upon more fundamental models of various phenomena, behaviors specific to the exploration activities should be entirely learned, so that they can be dynamically modified with ease. For feasibility, the system should be able to identify and adapt its effective prioritization of available indicators in evolving its decision strategies. The method(s) used should be dynamically extensible as the training data set is enlarged. Part D: Researching a Critical Reasoning Method The primary motivations for algorithm selection will come from flexibility— the ability to recognize general patterns and estimate  general  functions— and feasibility— the ability to perform classification and decision-making using a compact strategic representation. Hence the general thrust of this effort will lie in searching for powerful generalizations of more elementary schemes (e.g., parameter decision trees constructed by ID
1.  Probabilistic reasoning  When an autonomous agent is interacting with the real world, it is often the case that the environment is non-deterministic. This could occur if the agent is dealing with a dynamic environment, or if the agent needs to interact with human beings. In such situations, the agent may need probabilistic reasoning techniques to model the environment and make decisions. If the agent can make observations over time, then techniques such as hidden Markov models, Kalman filters, and dynamic Bayesian networks could be useful to make future predictions. Probabilistic reasoning techniques could be useful in applications such as speech recognition.  
2.  Machine learning with incomplete data     One possible attribute of an intelligent system is the capability to learn to make correct decisions based on available and possibly incomplete training data. It may require learning probability models such as Bayesian networks and making maximum probable hypotheses. Algorithms such as Markov chain Monte Carlo and expectation-maximization, and models such as Kernel models and neural networks may be useful. 
3.  Communicating, perceiving, and acting A robot that needs to interact with the environment must have a variety of methods of sensing and communication. Language recognition, tactile sensing, and visual image processing become critical for an interactive robot. In visual perception, object recognition, edge detection, contour mapping, and motion detection would be useful to study.   Part B: Favored Cognitive Robot  Current spacesuit development has been focused largely on the mechanical design, and little work has been done with respect to information interfacing with the astronaut. As a far-stretched idea, it may be useful for an astronaut to have immediate computer access within the spacesuit, where the information is projected onto the suit helmet. The controls to such a device could be voice-activated, or controlled by motion in the rest of the spacesuit. Imagine if an astronaut needed to get to a target ground feature that is not in plain view. S/he could pull up an archived aerial map of the area on the display, select an area on the display by simply moving his/her arm and finger in a circular motion, and the Hand motion Signal detection Filtered signal computer would be able to acknowledge the selected feature and have the map generate an optimal safest path to the feature. The astronaut can then follow the path in real time toward the destination.  In this complex system, I would like to focus on the motion control interface. If one has seen the Hollywood film Minority Report, or played video games with similar motion controls, then one has a good idea of how this interface is desired to work. Essentially the goal is that an astronaut can give commands by making some kind of gesture, since other forms of inputs (such as a keyboard) can be cumbersome or difficult to implement.   The spacesuit would need to sense the motion of the user, filter the important input signals, recognize the command, and respond accordingly. To implement these functions, the system needs a motion sensing system to gather the input data, probabilistic reasoning techniques to filter the data, and pattern recognition capabilities to actually use the data. Figure 1 shows a flow diagram of how a user command is detected.         Figure 
1) I am primarily interested in SLAM.  I plan to do my project on an application of SLAM, and thus I am interested not only in the method we learned about in class, but also the method outlined in the DP-SLAM reading on the course webpage.  I only want to implement one method, but I need to know how both methods work so that I can figure out which is easiest/best to implement.  I will probably want to do my advanced lecture on a SLAM algorithm. 
2) I am also interested in probabilistic roadmaps.  We covered basic probabilistic roadmaps in class, which is something that I use in my own research, to control two simulated robotic arms.  I am also interested in learning more about RRTs and MOPs, and would not mind doing an advanced lecture on a specific algorithm related to them. 
3) Finally, as a topic I am very interested in learning about in class that hasn't been covered, I am particularly interested in MDPs and POMDPs. I have learned about HMMs, but not about POMDPs, and the information in Russell and Norvig is woefully inadequate.

1.  Relationship with the system I want to implement I am interested in the idea of using a probabilistic description of the moutains. In my project, the robots may have or not a map. In any case, this map is not perfect, so a probabilistic description may fit well with my goal.   Paper 3  Title Applying Kinodynamic Randomized Motion Planning with a Dynamic Priority System to Multi-Robot Space Systems, C M Clark, T Bretl, S Rock  Why I chose this paper  In this paper, a new dynamic priority system is presented. Thanks to it, the robots whose environment is the most crowded has the highest priority to plan its path.  Major contributionsThis paper shows a new method to avoid collision: instead of the static priority system existing before, it presents a dynamic priority system, where the robots whose environments are the most crowded can decide their paths before others.  StrengthsThanks to the algorithm presented in this paper, a large team of robots can perform path planning while avoiding collisions, by setting cleverly the priorities between the various robots.  WeaknessesNo special weakness noted.  Relationship with papers 1 and 2 This paper is more interested in collision avoiding, while paper 1 deals with cooperation to reach the goals at the same time. Paper 2 dealt with a probabilistic representation of the constraints.  Relationship with the system I want to implement In the system I want to implement, I need a strategy to set the priorities in the team of robots. For instance, if the position of the people to rescue is unknown, they have to cooperate, in a certain priority order, to scan the whole area.      Part E For my project, I would like to design an intelligent code for UAVs trying to rescue people lost in mountains, while avoiding obstacles. There are various levels in this project, which I could do depending on how hard they are: -at a first level, one helicopter (here a point with basic kinematic restrictions) planning the fastest path to reach a known goal, in a known moutainous environment. -adding unknown threats. -having the goal uncertain / completely unknown. -adding other helicopters to cooperate (share map updates / people position updates / threats knowledge updates). -adding helicopter-like behaviour for the motion / adding fuel constraints. -adding altitude changes. -multiple people to save. -being as far as possible reachable by radio from the base.  I guess I could do the 3~4 first points. However, I do not know how ambitious it  is.  I will actually pursue this project, or maybe do something slightly different and  still related with Aeronautics/Space (for instance a team of UAVs attacking a target/several targets in ennemy territory). However, again, I do not know what is interesting or not, ambitious or not in this project.

Identify  properties  of  the  problems  that  seem  to  positively  or  negatively  affect  the performance of each algorithm.  What do you think are the strengths and weaknesses of one algorithm over the other? How difficult would it be to extend them to generate the  next  best  solution,  or  all  solutions?

5.  Summarize  each  team  member’s  contribution  to  the  implementation  and evaluation of the two algorithms.   Appendix.  In an appendix to your report, provide a print out of the source code of your programs.   Algorithm A: Conflict-directed A* Search  Implement  conflict-directed  A*  (CDA*)  to  compute  optimal  solutions  for  valued constraint satisfaction problems (VCSPs).  In order to apply CDA* to a VCSP, you first need to write a compiler that maps a VCSP into an optimal constraint satisfaction problem (OCSP).  This may be accomplished by applying  the  transformation  shown  in  lecture  by  Martin  Sachenbacher,  and  involves introducing a decision variable for each soft constraint.  Next,  implement  CDA*  by  using  a  search  queue  to  enumerate  the  assignments  to  the decision variables in best-first order, testing complete assignments for consistency, and using  conflicts  obtained  from  inconsistent  assignments  to  guide  the  expansion  of  the search tree.  CDA* as described in the paper by Williams and Ragno optimizes child expansion by expanding  only  the  best  child  and  next  best  sibling  of  a  search  node,  rather  than expanding  all  of  its  children  at  once.    If  you  would  like,  you  can  simplify  your implementation  of  the  algorithm  by  omitting  this  improvement  and  expanding  all children of a search node at once (however, we would be delighted if you implemented the original algorithm).  In order to facilitate implementation of the algorithm, we provide a component, called ISAT, which tests assignments for consistency with a set of constraints given as clauses in  propositional  state  logic,  and  returns  a  conflict  in  the  case  of  inconsistency. Propositional state logic is a propositional logic in which all propositions are assignments to  a  set  of  finite  domain  variables.    Note  that  ISAT  is  written  in  C++,  hence  your implementation of CDA* will either need to make a foreign function call to ISAT or you will need to implement CDA* in C++.  You can obtain a CD containing the C/C++ code of  ISAT  and  a  description  of  how  to  use  ISAT  from  the  course  secretary,  Brian O’Conaill  .    Should  you  have  any  further  questions  regarding  ISAT, please do not hesitate to direct your question to Shen Qu.   Further reading:  •  Brian C.

RDS  is  a  branch-and-bound  algorithm  that  replaces  one  search  by  n  searches  on successively  larger  subproblems  (n  is  the  number  of  variables  in  the  problem).    RDS records the result for each subproblem, and uses it to improve the lower bounds of partial assignments when solving the next largest subproblem.

4. The space complexity for BTE is not very conclusive for the three problems that successfully ran. Memory is not an issue for the RDS algorithm because it is based on a depth-first search, and only stores the current assignment.  The RDS algorithm implementation only keeps 1 copy of each assignment variable in memory at a time, with the exception of temporary variables.  Consequently, memory use is linear (O(n)) to the number of problem variables.  This is a search algorithm rather than a variable elimination algorithm. As such, only 1 copy of the constraints is kept in memory at a time.  Therefore, memory use is also linear to the number of tuples and variables in the constraints. Comparison of Results Neither algorithm was able to solve the majority of the problems. The BTE algorithm ran out of memory for all problems except three. The RDS algorithm took longer than ten minutes to reach a solution for all but five problems. The results from the problems that were successfully solved are summarized in Table

1.  	 (1  points)  From  the  readings  and  lecture,  please  describe  the  sliding  filament mechanism. SOLUTION: •	 Muscle filaments are composed of actin and myosin proteins.  The muscle myofibril contraction results from the relative sliding of actin and myosin. •	 The contraction results from the myosin heads forming crossbridges on active sites of the  actin.  The  isometric  tension  output  is  directly  proportional  to  the  number  of crossbridges formed (T-L curve). •	 The  myosin  heads  go  through  a  cyclic  motion  (attach  on  actin  /  pull  /  detach  / attach…), allowing to create the pulling force while contracting •	 Muscle  shortening  should  be  based  on  the  relative  motion  of  sliding  filaments because: A.  A-band width stays constant during stretch and shortening B.  A-band disappears when myosin is dissolved away C.  Actin filaments begin at Z-line, run through I-bands into A-band, but stop before reaching H-zone (muscle at rest length) D.  I-band is entirely actin filaments E.  H-zone is myosin filaments In  shortening,  the  relationship  between  the  Force  and  Velocity  is  (Hill's  Curve, Hyperbolic Form): •	(T+a)(v+b) = (T0+a)b where T0 = isometric tension (velocity = 
2.  (1 points) Briefly discuss muscle coactivation. SOLUTION: Typically referred to as the α−γ (alpha-gamma) coactivation principle, it can be used to better understand movement control. More specifically, α−γ (alpha-gamma) coactivation can be described as muscle commands being signaled simultaneously with increases in both α and γ activity by higher order motor centers. This alleviates the problem of contraction of the extrafusal muscle mass and a slackening of the spindles if only α motor activity changes (say increased). The stretch reflex would then come into play as the Ia afferent activity drops, causing the α motor activity to fall, thus, turning the muscle force off. In short, α−γ coactivation alleviates this problem. Evidence from electromyography (EMG electrodes that measure muscle activity) from indwelling intrafusal and extrafusal electrodes record muscle fibers of the hand show that an increase in discharges from the spindle afferents occurs at the same time or only slightly after the beginning of electrical activity in the extrafusal muscle. The slight delay is accounted for by the time required for the intrafusal fibers to contract.  More information (i.e., food for thought). A motor command via the alpha motoneurons can only be effective in the presence of adequate facilitation from muscle spindles. If alpha activation leads to muscle shortening then the unloading of the spindle will reduce alpha motoneuron activity unless spindle afferent output is maintained by fusimotor activity. The logical way to maintain or increase spindle input (to alpha motoneurons) is to drive the static bag 2 fibers via the static gamma system. This biases Ia output. Dynamic bag 1 fiber biasing action is too small for use except in small slow movements. Appropriate action is therefore coactivation of alpha and gamma with the gamma receiving a modulated pattern based on the alpha pattern. As muscle shortens, Ia discharge is maintained. This explains the lack of change in Ia output seen in human movement. Compensation for spindle unloading could also come from the group II pathway by increasing static fusimotor output to chain fibers with secondary endings. There would be powerful biasing action in this case. Note that the above conditions keep the spindle responsive to unexpected length changes resulting from fatigue, change in load or obstruction of movement.  If you want to model planned movements, two messages are required.  
1.  Attach a local reference frame that rotates and translates with the subject on the SAFER (call this the “body frame”).  Expressing the forces and torques in the body frame, derive the translational and rotational dynamics that describe the motion in the inertial reference frame.  (You can assume that all forces and torques are applied through the center of mass of the subject / SAFER system).  Justify any assumptions make regarding what effects to model and which ones you are leaving out.  
2.  Using Simulink, develop a computational model that simulates the motion of the subject on the training SAFER unit.    A Simulink model has been started for you called dynamics_prob
3.  Copy the dynamics you created in part 2 into dynamics_prob
4.  Using the random noise input blocks again, create simulated noisy measurements of the x and y position as well as the angular displacement by adding noise to the position outputs of your dynamics.  You can use the measurement random noise blocks provided to you in dynamics_prob
5.  Using the “To Workspace” blocks, output the true position and velocity as well as your noisy measurements to the workspace.  These blocks have been provided to you in dynamics_prob
6.  Write a Kalman filter that estimates the position, velocity (both x and y), angle and angular rate of the subject on the SAFER training unit.  Use the noisy x position, y position and angular position measurements you created in part 4 as measurements.  To start your simulation, add a random initial estimation error by taking the truth and adding random noise to it (using the randn Matlab function).  The noise should be zero mean with the following variances:  x-y initial position error variance:  
7.  Plot the estimation error resulting from your Kalman filter with the covariance bounds on either side.  The covariance bounds are found by taking ± square root of the diagonal elements of the covariance matrix at every time step.  How much better is your position estimate versus what you would have had if you used just the measurements alone (i.e., without using a filter at all)?   
8.  How would you modify the filter above if there were unknown frictional effects on the PABF?  What if you knew what the friction was?  Would that change how you dealt with it?

1. Compare the heart rate and blood pressure at time = +100 sec to the baseline values at time = −10 sec. What is the physiologic basis for the observed change in arterial BP?    Description: Before and after the stand test, the heart rate remains fixed at 68 beats/min.  The systemic arterial pressure (ABP) is 117/72 mmHg (average = 
2. The curves in Figure 3 show the patient’s status at time = −10 sec. Using the axes provided, sketch CO/VR curves and a LV P-V loop to represent the hemodynamics at time = +100 sec. (Hint: First estimate the new CO assuming constant peripheral resistance.)  The post-standing  LV P-V loop is determined by the post-standing systolic pressure (60 mmHg), the post-standing diastolic pressure (38 mmHg), and the post-standing stroke 1 of 5 volume (SV is proportional to pulse pressure, which is systolic pressure minus diastolic pressure (cid:
3.  The post-standing venous return curve is determined by estimating the post-standing cardiac output, CO.  We know that cardiac output is equal to stroke volume times heart rate (CO = HR*SV), and that stroke volume is proportional to pulse pressure.  In the previous paragraph, we discussed that the pulse pressure, and thus the stroke volume, decrease by a factor of two upon standing.  Consequently, the cardiac output also decreases by a factor of two (in other words, it is cut in half).  To draw the new venous return curve, we place the equilibrium point on 0 mmHg right atrial pressure but at half the cardiac output.  Then, we draw the rest of the venous return curve with the same slope as the pre-standing venous return curve.  To intersect the venous return curve but also maintain an equilibrium point at 0 mmHg, the post-standing cardiac output curve must move to the right and have a decrease in slope.    2 of 5 
4. Why is the mean BP at 100 seconds slightly higher than the control level? (You may use the approximation Pm = Pd + 1/3 (Ps − Pd ).)   Mean BP is equal to cardiac output times total peripheral resistance (Pm = CO * TPR).  With sympathetic stimulation working (i.e., control system “on”), the peripheral resistance increases substantially while the cardiac output decreases just slightly.  The net effect is an increase in the product of CO and TPR, or an increase in Pm.  Another way to look at this is that increased peripheral resistance causes an increase in diastolic pressure without much of a change to systolic pressure.  Thus, the mean pressure increases upon standing.   
5. Using the axes of Figure 3 sketch the new situation at t = 100 sec. Demonstrate the expected impact of the control mechanisms by appropriately modifying the curves. Hint: Estimate the new CO by assuming that stroke volume is proportional to pulse pressure (systolic–diastolic ABP). Fill in the work sheet below as a guide to drawing the curves.  Parameter HR CO SV Pulse Press. Mean ABP  (Follow procedure of Problem 2 to create the LV P-V curve.)  [CORRECTION:] It is important to note that the data given to us in Problem 5 indicates that the stroke volume decreases, and this precludes the possibility of increased contractility, which is a control mechanism that would typically happen upon sympathetic stimulation. (Increased contractility causes stroke volume to increase rather than to decrease.) According to Problem 5’s assumption that stroke volume is proportional to pulse pressure, stroke volume decreases upon standing. Consequently, the venous return curve must also decrease, as shown in Figure 
6. What shifts of blood volume would you expect in the early hours of weightlessness? Explain your rationale.  In the absence of gravity, first the blood that is normally attracted towards the feet will shift and be redistributed in the upper parts of the body. This is part of the total body fluid shift that occurs when weightlessness begins.  Next, the volume sensors that are used to measure pressure at the atria will detect the increase in upper-body blood volume and thus measure the increase in upper-body pressure that has occurred.  To reduce the pressure in the upper body, the cardiovascular control system takes action to reduce the volume of blood in the body by eliminating plasma through urine.  Consequently, after a few hours of weightlessness, there will be a significant reduction in total blood volume.     4 of 5 
7. Why is the post-flight stand test result different from the pre-flight result?  As described above, the microgravity environment eventually causes a loss of total blood volume (typically about 500 mL are lost). Furthermore, the heart’s cardiac output decreases because the removal of the hydrostatic pressure gradient requires much less work from the heart.  When the astronaut returns to gravity and conducts a stand test, the heart must compensate for the decreased blood volume and decreased cardiac output by producing a much larger increase in heart rate upon standing.    While total blood volume has the largest effect on the heart rate increase, we can mention at least three additional spaceflight-induced causes of the difference between the post-flight and pre-flight responses to standing. They include:  
8. Can you think of any countermeasures to reduce the problem of orthostatic hypotension? (Consider mechanical, pharmacological, or other methods.)  -  Fluid loading immediately before return to gravity -  Pharmaceuticals, that cause increase in total peripheral resistance or stroke volume -  Pharmaceuticals that increase heart rate -  Mechanical counterpressure around legs to augment venous return -  Aerobic exercise in space to maintain oxygen uptake rate 5 of 5

Part A (2 points): Briefly summarize the sequence of physiological events that occur when a person/animal changes posture from the supine to the head-up posture.   Part B (8 points):  The Mercury-Atlas 9 mission sent Astronaut L. Gordon Cooper to space for a U.S. record-breaking 34 hours. While his health prior and during flight was excellent, egress from the space capsule imposed a substantial burden on his cardiovascular system:  "The postflight examination began prior to egress from the spacecraft. Approximately 40 minutes after landing, two measurements of the astronaut's [Cooper's] blood pressure were recorded while he was still lying in the spacecraft on the deck of the recovery ship. He was then able to egress from the spacecraft without assistance and stand erect on the deck while his blood pressure was again recorded on the onboard tape.  Later examination of this 3 1/2 minute record shows that, while he was still in the spacecraft, his blood pressures were 101/65 and 105/87, with a corresponding heart rate of 132 beats per minute. During egress and immediately thereafter, while standing upright on the deck, his heart rate rose to 188 beats per minute […].  At that point, another blood pressure recording was attempted and, although the apparatus appeared to cycle normally, no pressure pulses were seen on the recording.  His heart then returned to a normal sinus rhythm with a rate of 92 beats per minute at sensor disconnect.  After standing on the deck for approximately a minute, the pilot began to look pale and, although his face was already wet, new beads of perspiration appeared on his forehead. He swayed slightly and reported symptoms of impending loss of consciousness including lightheadedness, dimming of vision, and tingling of his feet and legs. The cable was immediately disconnected and, with support at each arm, he began to walk away from the spacecraft. After a few steps, 5 to 10 seconds later, he was able to walk without assistance and to salute the ship's commanding officer."  Taken from: Manned Spacecraft Center (U.S.).

In bone, the imparted stress signals bone formation, resorption, and steady-state homeostasis. Bone demineralization seems to be linked to stress presented by external loading and to musculature. The activity of muscles is greatly reduced when posture control is no longer the same (or no longer needed in spaceflight), therefore, altering the stress-strain profile. This phenomena gives rise to the result above (slow twitch fibers atrophy more, especially the extensor muscles since they have the majority of slow fibers types and these are the primary antigravity muscles). The stress-strain musculoskeletal response is critical, especially subjected to bending moments and torsion. Frost’s mechanostat theory suggests that bone maintains a certain strain level. The system witnesses a decrease from the musculature and, therefore, reduced strain on the skeleton, which results in an exacerbated physiological deconditioning of the musculoskeletal system. There is an integrated physiological effect going on dependent on gravity as well as each other (musculo-skeletal dependence). Physiological deconditioning from spaceflight manifests itself as the need for an adaptive response to 1G upon return from spaceflight. CNS recruitment of muscle fibers necessary for movement in 1G for musculoskeletal performance and motor control. The need in 1G to maintain upright posture has to account for altered posture etiology: atrophy due to a decrease in CNS recruitment of antigravity muscles and perhaps a concomitant decrease in the contractile proteins synthesized in muscle. You also have an instantaneous skeletal loading in 1G that requires an adaptive response, not to mention orthostatic intolerance.1 1 In general, the illustrations provided were much appreciated and demonstrated your learning. 6

4.  Present your results in a ﬁnal review and report and determine TRL level after research eﬀort. 1 To characterize the thruster performance you will use the following methods: Ion  Beam  Current  Measurement:  To  measure  the  current,  use  a  metallic  plate  large enough  to  pick  up  all  the  ions  emitted  by  the  thruster.  The  plate  should  be  connected  to ground through a resistor (about 100 kΩ) and situated at a distance > 30 cm from the face of the thruster.  Measure the voltage drop and use the resistor value to calculate the current. A metallic mesh of known transparency should be positioned a few mm from the plate and biased to some negative potential to repel secondary electrons.  You should also measure the potential drop across a resistor in series with the power supply.  This will give you the total current going to the thruster, and therefore the input power. Ion Beam Energy Measurement:  The beam energy can be characterized with a retarding potential analyzer (RPA). A collector plate (can be much smaller than the current measuring plate) is biased to a voltage in the range from zero to about

1. A perfect gas is passed through a sudden expansion in a duct.  The expansion area ratio is three.  Just downstream of the expansion an amount of heat, Q, per unit time, is added to the stream.. The flow at the exit of the smaller diameter duct and at a location several diameters downstream in the large pipe can be considered uniform across the duct.   The Mach numbers everywhere are much less than one.  What is the change in static pressure from just upstream of the exit of the smaller diameter duct to the downstream station in the larger diameter duct? a) The static pressure rises b) The static pressure does not change c) The static pressure decreases Why?  (Several clear sentences that explain the reason for the answer are needed.  There is no credit without these explanations.  Equations can be used if you think they are helpful in answering.) .

1) Mechanisms of inlet vortex formation - computational demonstration of the inlet vortex formation.  Quantification of the vortex circulation.   There are two separate mechanisms and either or both can be examined.   As far as the instructors know, this has not been done in the literature. 
2) Vorticity generation and downstream mixing in lobed mixers – What is the “mechanism” for the normal vorticity to evolve into streamwise vorticity? 
3)  Secondary flow in curved inlets.  The Cambridge-MIT silent aircraft design has an S-curved inlet, with a thick boundary layer entering.   What is the effect of the boundary layer properties on separation, how could separation be avoided, what might vortex generators do, what sort of flow control could be used? 
4) Upstream effects of an engine on inlet distortion.  We saw in class that the stagnation pressure distribution in front of a fan could be greatly altered by the presence of an engine.  How strong an effect is this?   When does it occur? 
5) Diffusing of a flow which has an embedded streamwise vortex.   This project would investigate “vortex breakdown” which occurs when a vortex is subjected to an adverse pressure gradient or even the situation of streamwise vorticity in a constant area duct.  The key issue is the generation of a theta-component of vorticity and thus a retardation of the flow in the inner part of the duct. 
6)  Averaging for a purpose—what are some useful averages that correspond to different situations (see Cumpsty and Horlock)?   When does it make a difference what average one takes?   How can one categorize the situation? 
7)  We have discussed the horseshoe vortex in front of a strut in qualitative terms.   What is the quantitative behavior?   What is the circulation of the vortex?  What is the vorticity distribution?  What is the secondary flow?  For different boundary layer thicknesses, or different strut thicknesses, how does the stand-off distance of the vortex scale? 
8)  Taylor column – The photographs of the small cylinder being dragged across a container of rapidly rotating fluid are spectacular in showing the two-dimensional nature of the flow.  What happens as the rotation rate is decreased?  How does the drag change?  When does the Taylor column cease to exist? 
9) Secondary flow in a bend.  It was predicted (and experimentally demonstrated) that the direction of the secondary flow in a bend, or a rotating straight pipe, would not grow monotonically as implied by the simple Squire-Winter analysis but will oscillate.   This project would examine how well the simple predictions capture the features of an “actual” flow and where they break down.

Note that you do not have to consider the lengths of the edges in solving this problem. Problem 4 Consider the Traveling Salesman Problem with Backhauls (TSPB), a version of the TSP which is as follows:  Suppose we have one “station point,” s, a set D of “delivery” points (|D| = n) and a set P of “pick-up” points (|P| = m).  Assume the travel medium is the Euclidean plane and that all n+m+1 points in the problem are distinct, so that the Euclidean distance between any pair of points is positive.  We want to design a tour of minimum length that has this description: a vehicle will begin from s, will visit first all the n points in D to deliver packages, will then (without first returning to s) visit all m points in P to pick up packages and will finally go back to s (where the tour ends). The following heuristic, based on the idea of the Christofides heuristic for the TSP, has been proposed recently for the TSPB (we shall leave Step 4 incomplete until the second question of our problem): Step 1: Construct: (a) TD, the minimum spanning tree of D, i.e., the MST that  connects all n delivery points; (b) TP, the minimum spanning tree of P, i.e., the MST that connects all m pick-up points. Now connect s to the delivery point in D which is closest to s.  Also connect s to the pick-up point in P which is closest to s. In this way a single tree, T, is formed which consists of TD, TP, s, and the two links connecting s to TD and TP, respectively.  Step 2: Transform the (n+m+
3.  The minimum spanning tree T of G3 for our example is shown in Figure 3d; note that because, in this case, k=2, T and G3 are identical. Step 4:  Construct a new graph G4 by adding to G2 two directed edges for each edge in T.  The two edges corresponding to an edge (V,W) in T join the two vertices i∈V and j∈W, whose distance c(i, j) equals c(V,W) and go in opposite directions.  [For our example, assume that c(V,W) = c(E,C).  Hence, we draw a directed edge from C to E and a directed edge from E to C and add them to G2 to obtain G4, as shown in Figure 3e.] Step 5:  Draw an Euler tour through the mixed graph G4, beginning and ending at the required point and making sure to traverse all the directed edges in the correct direction.  This tour is a solution to the DTP. (a) Please explain briefly why the mixed graph G4 has an Euler tour. (b) Argue briefly that, if k=1 after Step 2, the above heuristic provides an optimal solution to the DTP. (c) Let L(G

Exactly 50% of the customers require a service that takes exactly 1 minute, while the other 50% require service that takes exactly 3 minutes.  “1-minute customers” and “3-minute customers” arrive randomly intermingled.  There is infinite queue capacity. (a) (20 points) Suppose that “1-minute customers” are assigned non-preemptive priority over “3­minute customers”.  Find the expected waiting time (i.e., not including time spent in service) for (i) “1-minute customers”, (ii) “3-minute customers” and (iii) a randomly selected customer. Furthermore, (iv) compare your answer to (iii) with the expected waiting time of a random customer, if all customers were served in a First-Come, First-Served (FCFS) order at the facility, irrespective of the length of their service time.

[NUMERICAL ANSWERS ARE EXPECTED FOR PARTS (i) – (iv).] (b) (9 points) Suppose now that the demand rate increases to 40 per hour (with 50% “1-minute customers” and 50% “3-minute customers”).  Suppose, as well, that “1-minute customers” are assigned non-preemptive priority over “3-minute customers”.  Compute the expected waiting time for (i) “1-minute customers” and (ii) “3-minute customers”. (c) (3 points) With the situation as in (b), i.e., a demand rate of 40 per hour, suppose now that “3­minute customers” are assigned non-preemptive priority over “1-minute customers”.

No math please! 1 Problem 2 (32 points) Three ambulances are positioned symmetrically at the three respective corners of an equilateral triangle, as shown in the figure.  Each triangle leg is two miles in length.  Calls for ambulance service are uniformly and independently distributed over the edges of the triangle.  These calls arrive in time as a homogeneous Poisson process with a total rate of λ calls per hour from the entire triangle.  Mean on scene time at an ambulance call for service, including the time it takes the ambulance to travel back to its home location at one of the corners of the triangle, is one hour.  The pdf for this on-scene time is negative exponential.  Response speed is 60 miles per hour, so -– as the usual engineering approximation --- we can forget travel time as part of service time.  The dispatcher always assigns a closest available ambulance to a call for service and the ambulance always takes the shortest route to the call it is dispatched to. There is an infinite capacity queue allowed.  Queued calls are handled in the first come, first served manner. (a)  What is the mean response distance (i.e., travel distance for the ambulance to travel to the scene of the call for service)  when λ = 10-6? (b)  What is the maximum allowable value of λ, such that for any value greater than this value, no steady state exists and the queue will grow without bound?  Call this value λmax . (c)  Suppose now we have a very high value of λ, say λ = λmax – epsilon, where epsilon is very small but positive.  What is the mean response distance in this case?  Explain how you derive it!

5.  At the intersection of these two barriers is a point through which vehicles can pass.

(ii)	 What is the maximum possible increase in grid distance caused by the barriers?  Briefly explain.(iii)	 What is the mean travel distance between two points in the city for which the grid distance is greater because of the barriers? Problem 4 (30 points) Consider a queueing system with two parallel servers and no space for queueing. This facility serves two types of customers.  Type 1 customers arrive in a Poisson manner at a rate of λ1 per minute.  The service time to these customers has a negative exponential pdf with a rate of μ1 per minute for each server.  Note that any Type 1 customers who find both servers busy are lost. Type 2 customers are more unusual.  They too arrive in a Poisson manner at a rate of λ2 per minute.  However, each one of these customers occupies simultaneously TWO servers (i.e., both of the servers).  The servers work together on each of these Type 2 customers.  The service time to these customers also has a negative exponential pdf with a rate of μ2 per minute.  (Note that this means that the two servers begin and end service to each Type 2 customer simultaneously and, together, can serve μ2 Type 2 customers per minute if working continuously on Type 2 customers.)  Type 2 customers who do not find two available servers upon arrival are lost. (a)  (6 points) What is the condition for this system to reach steady state?

(c)  (6 points) Write expressions for the fraction of Type 1 customers and for the fraction of Type 2 customers who are lost by this system, assuming that the system is in steady state.  Your expressions should be in terms of λ1, μ1, λ2 and μ
1.  Several things have, however, changed in this problem:  Type 2 customers are described differently; the queueing capacity of the system is 2 instead of 0; and some of the questions are different, as well.] Consider a queueing system with two parallel servers and two spaces for queueing (in addition to the two servers). This facility serves two types of customers.  Type 1 customers are of the conventional type.  They arrive in a Poisson manner at a rate of λ1 per minute.  The service time to these customers has a negative exponential pdf with a rate of µ1 per minute for each server.  Any arriving Type 1 customers who find the system full (i.e., 4 customers in the system) are lost. Type 2 customers are unusual.  They, too, arrive in a Poisson manner at a rate of λ2 per minute, but they arrive IN PAIRS.  [Think of a restaurant, where some of the customers (Type 
2) arrive in pairs.]  Moreover, when service to each one of these pairs begins, the pair occupies simultaneously TWO servers (i.e., both of the servers).  The servers work together on each of these Type 2 pairs.  The service time to the pair has a negative exponential pdf with a rate of µ2 per minute.  (Note that this means that the two servers begin and end service to each Type 2 pair simultaneously and, together, can serve µ2 Type 2 pairs per minute if working continuously on Type 2 pairs.)  Type 2 customers who do not find at least TWO available spaces upon arrival are lost. [Please note:  A Type 2 pair cannot occupy the servers, unless both servers are available.  Thus, in the case where one Type 1 customer is in service and the only customers waiting are one Type 2 pair, the Type 2 pair must still wait in queue and the second server remains idle.] (a)  (20 points) Please draw carefully a state transition diagram that describes this queueing system.

Your expression should be solely in terms of λ1, µ1, λ2 and µ

Thus  E[u] + E[t] = E[h] Clearly the sum of these two expected values is the expected value of time between busses for a randomly chosen interval. Let’s answer the second one first. Since arrivals are Poisson and the Poisson process is memoryless the time from when Mendel arrives to the next bus is clearly a Poisson random variable with parameter � . Thus  E[u] =

1. (b) From Figure 1 it can be seen that the event of interest can happen only by having a set of three consecutive transitions from state (1, 0, 
2) to (1, 1, 
3. In order to solve this part we add 4 units of weight to a node already in the network and see if the optimal facility will be located at the node. If we do this for all 4 nodes but D (which cannot be used) we find that only when we locate the families at node B do we have a tie between B and D and thus B is an optimal location, all other nodes are inferior. We then realize that we only need to perform a local analysis on the arcs that connect two optimal node locations.  For the example above this turns out to be nodes B and D, thus only points along arc (B,D) need to be considered. Considering moving a very small number e units off B shows that D becomes the optimal facility as does moving a small number of units off D towards B shows that D will remain the optimal complex.  Thus, the only place to locate the four new families is at complex B. It is important to note that for other weights (other than 4 families) it is indeed possible to have optimal locations be on arcs. For example, if the additional families were 10,000, any point on any arc in the network where these 10,000 families are located is optimal. It is not correct to say that the optimal location will always be at an existing node when the facility has demand units attached to it. 
4.  The idea here was to simply balance the weights so the facility doesn’t move. The easiest way to do this is: “for every unit we locate at node A, we locate another unit at Node E” thus balancing the changes in demand weights. Thus an optimal way to locate the families without changing the location of the optimal facility is to locate 25 families at A and 25 families at E. The next 3 parts were about the stochastic queue median. The first two can be answered without any math. 
5. The answer is true. The reason is since the rate of demand is close to zero there are virtually no calls the facility must be located at the median.  But because the weights on the two sides are equal, the facility can be located anywhere along the link. However if the rate of calls was greater then zero then the answer would only have been node D, this is due to the variance in service times. 
6. By the symmetry of demand at nodes A and E the optimal location of the facility is clearly the midpoint node D. 
7. Here we need to use the equations given to us in the handout on the stochastic queue median. We will follow the handout. But first we redraw the diagram so that our computations are easier. 3 x=-.5 A=-1 E=1 E [ R ] =  E [W ] +  E [ S ] E [ R ] =  E [ S ] + λ[( E [ S ]) 2  + σ 2 ]s 2(1 − λE [ S ])E [d ] =  f a  (1 + .

If, after the completion of a service, there is at least one customer waiting, then customers (if any) of the same type as the customer who just completed service receive priority over the other type.

A              B           C  The pictures above the sectors are shown to remind you that we are dealing with police patrol cars, each of which patrols its own sector, A, B or C, respectively, uniformly when not responding to a call for service. The dispatch strategy (or, ‘server assignment’ strategy) is as follows:  If a call for service arises in a given sector, dispatch that sector’s police car, if it is available; otherwise dispatch the closest available police car.  If all three police cars are simultaneously busy when the call arrives, the call is LOST to the system forever.  Thus, police cars are dispatched only from the idle or patrolling state. Since it will be patrolling when dispatched, the police car’s location upon dispatch is drawn from a uniform distribution over its one-mile-long sector.  Calls for police service arise in accordance with a homogeneous Poisson process, with rate ! = 
1.  Patrolling Police Car. A patrolling police car is assigned to the rectangular sector shown in the figure.  The sector is bounded on all four sides by a roadway that requires 50% of the police car’s patrolling time.  The other 50% of the time, the car patrols the inner rectangular part of the sector.  Thus, at a random time when the police car is available for dispatch, the police car’s location is equally likely to be drawn from a uniform distribution over the bounding roadway or by a uniform distribution over the rectangular part of the sector inside the bounding roadway.  Travel is right-angle or the Manhattan metric, with directions of travel parallel to the sides of the rectangle.  911 calls for service are also distributed randomly over the rectangular sector, in the same way as the police car and independently of the location of the police car.  That is, 50% of the 911 calls are uniformly distributed over the bounding roadway and 50% uniformly distributed over the inner rectangular part of the sector.  Given a random call for service at a give location, the police car will follow a minimum distance right-angle path from its current location to the location of the call.  Thus, we assume that the police car can exit the bounding 2 km bounding roadway 1 km roadway at any point, and – as is usual with the right angle metric, we ignore the complication of ‘city blocks’, assuming instead an infinitely divisible right-angle travel space within the region. (a) Find the mean distance traveled by the police car in response to a random call for service. Key methods:	- “Divide & Conquer”- Expected distance between two random pointsLogistical and Transportation PlanningThe police car can either be on the highway or in the inner part of the sector, and it is the same for the random call for service. Therefore, we have four different cases. The probabilities of those events are summarized in the table: Police Car Highway Inner Part 119llaCHighway Case 1: 1/4 Case 2: 1/4 Inner Part Case 3: 1/4 Case 4: 1/4 For each case, we will determine the expected distance. •	 Case 1: We have to use the method “Divide and Conquer” again. If the call and the car are on two opposite portions of the highway, then the car has to cross the inner rectangular region, whereas if they are on the same portion of the highway, the car does not have to travel across that region. Thus, the expected distance depends on which part of the highway the call and cars are. Note: the car can go off the highway, therefore, the problem cannot be reduced to a 1-D problem.

The distance will depend on which portion of the highway the call originates from. The police car will have to either all the way up or down, or right or left. Call from a smallrectilinear portion of the highway12P  = = 63 Call from a long portion of the highway P  = 46= 2	3 E [D ] =  E [D x ]+  E [D Y  ] 41 1 E [D ] = ⋅ 2 + ⋅1 = 233 E [D ] =  E [D x ]+  E [D Y  ]71 1 ⋅ 2 +⋅1 = E [D ] = 326Therefore, the expected distance is this case is  E[] D  = •	 Case 3: 1 4⋅	 + 3	 32 7  11 ⋅	 = 3 6 9 It is similar to Case 2, with the roles for car and the call inverted.

They are both from the uniform region, therefore the answer is simply: [  ] = E  D X ]+ E  DY ] = E D [ [13⋅ 2 + 1 3 ⋅1 = 1 Finally, the expected distance is[  ] = E D ⎛1 ⎜⎝4 1 + 2 ⋅⎞11  4 ⎟⎠3 + 9= 43 . 36 (b) Now assume we have a barrier to travel that rises vertically from the midway point on the lower boundary of the sector to 1/2 km inside the sector.  (See figure on next page.)  The barrier does not stop travel along the bounding roadway near the barrier.  It only prohibits east-west and west-east travel through the barrier Logistical and Transportation Planningwithin the interior of the sector.  Now find the mean distance traveled in the presence of the barrier. There are a lot of cases to consider when computing the expected distance. In order to reduce the computations we have to make, we will use the “perturbation” method: E[D] = E[Dnormal ]+ E[D perturbation ] . The barrier creates a perturbation when the call and the police car are on both sides of it.

Problem #2: Passenger Mix Model In  this  problem,  you  are  asked  to  formulate  and  implement  the  Passenger  Mix  Model described in class.  This problem serves as an exercise on row and column generation.   PART A: Solving the initial Restricted Master Problem for the PMM Model 
9. Problem? Now, consider the slightly modified problem.   Suppose that fares are flight based (i.e., it cost $c(f) for a passenger to fly on flight f) and there is no recapture.  The fare  associated  therefore,  with  an  itinerary  corresponds  to  the  sum  of  the  fares associated with the flight leg traversed.  Describe but do not compute the steps of an  efficient  algorithm  to  solve  the  problem.    In  a  real  size  airline  planning,  how would  you  consider,  in  the  column  generation  problem,  the  constraint  that itineraries cannot have more than 3 flight legs?  Discuss complexity issues.  -4-

4.  Assume  for  now  that  all  the  passengers  are  locals  (they  fly  on  one  flight  only): Calculate the objective coefficients of the basic Fleet Assignment Model (FAM), which minimizes the profitability (sum of the operating costs and the spill costs), and find the optimal solution using OPL Studio.

9.  Write  the  Fleet  Assignment  Model  mathematically  for  the  general  case,  and clearly define your variables, parameters and sets.  How would you model the following constraints?   
10. Station exclusion: Due to restrictions, fleet type f cannot fly into airport j. 
11. Noise restriction: Due to municipal laws, no more than 30% of departures out of airport j can be of fleet type f or g. 
12. Crew: The number of flying hours of fleet f cannot exceed the maximum number of available crew hours, . C(f)
13. Require through: A required through flight corresponds to connecting flight legs with  the  same  flight  number  (which  is  interesting  for  marketing  purposes).    This means that both flight legs (say  i and ) must be of the same fleet type.  How 12iwould you model this? 
14. Two-service maintenance: The two-service maintenance for fleet f are at airport: j,  k  and  m.    At  least  n  aircraft  of  fleet  type  f  must  overnight  at  one  of  these airports.   -3-

2. Instead of thinking about a pairing as a sequence of flights, we can think of it as a sequence of duties. How would you define a network for the pricing problem in this case? What constitutes a node in this network? An arc? Demonstrate how a path in this network corresponds to a pairing and how the cost of this path corresponds to the reduced cost of the pairing. In order to use this network to find the most negative reduced cost pairing, we must solve a multi-label shortest path problem. Define the elements included in a label. 
3.  Outline an algorithm for solving this multi-label shortest path problem. Pay particular attention to describing when one label dominates another.  1
4.  Compare these two approaches (i.e. flight-based versus duty-based pairing generation). Which network would you expect to have more nodes? Would you expect more or fewer labels kept at each node, on average? Which method do you think would work better in a domestic network? An international network? 
5.  Consider the special case where pairings are not allowed to have more than two duties. How would you modify the duty-based network to take this into account? Do you still need to use a multi-label shortest path algorithm, or can you solve a basic shortest path problem?       Problem 2: An Alternative Way to Integrate Crew Pairing and Maintenance Routing  In the extended crew pairing model (ECP) we start with a restricted master problem that guarantees feasibility, and then iteratively add maintenance routing columns to improve solution quality. In this exercise, we consider an alternative approach, where we instead start with an unconstrained version of the crew pairing problem and add maintenance routing constraints to enforce feasibility.   
6.  Consider this approach of alternating between solving the unconstrained crew pairing problem and adding constraints based on minimally infeasible forced turns sets. Is this algorithm guaranteed to terminate in a finite number of steps? Why or why not? If it terminates, are you guaranteed an optimal solution to the integrated crew pairing/maintenance routing problem?  3
1.   Team Formation  Form or join a team with exactly five students in it. No team can have more than five members in it. It is possible for a team to have fewer students, but only once all other teams have filled up.    Students at MIT and EPFL should join with other students from their own school. Mixed teams, while perhaps interesting, are generally discouraged due to the additional overhead associated with time difference and other complications. If, however, a mixed team emerges we will consider approving it with special approval from the instructor.    Discuss and write a team charter. The charter should be one page long (about 300 words) and contain a description of your “identity” and goals as a team. For example you should discuss whether you are serious about competing at the 2016 Cansat competition, or simply want to do a good job and meet the requirements of the class.    1                     Both positions are fine. In the charter you should also identify the special skills, knowledge that each person brings to the team and how you plan to leverage those skills. 
2.   Definitions As a team discuss, converge on and write down a definition for the following items. These definitions should be original. This means you should not look them up in a book or on the internet, but come up with them yourselves based on your past experience, what you’ve learned in the class so far and discussions amongst the team. If you cannot converge on a particular definition, you should say so and why and provide the alternate definition(s). The process you follow to try and reach consensus is up to you. -­­  System -­­  Engineering -­­  Systems Engineering -­­  Systems Engineer1 -­­  Stakeholder -­­  Milestone -­­  Need Warning: This seems like an easy task at first, but it is not.

A historical project that suffered from poor requirements  Identify a project that did not go smoothly due to problems that are traceable to  poorly written, missing, not verified or very volatile requirements. An example of such  a project was the 1998-­­1999 Mars Climate Orbiter (MCO) presented in class, so you  should find a different example. We recommend the following process:    a)   Brainstorm projects that went poorly due to requirements (as a team)  b)   Pick one of these projects and do some background research (e.g. their might  be a GAO report in the U.S. due to cost and schedule overruns, accident  investigation reports etc.…).  c)   Write a short essay, about 500-­­600 words about what the major problems  were and relate these to what we discussed in class (session

3.   Cansat 2016 requirements definition Based on your rewritten/critiqued requirements from task 2, create your own requirements document or database for the 2016 Cansat competition. Take into account the following points: a)   In addition to the 47 “base” requirements add the environmental testing requirements for Cansat 2016 (separate document) b)   How do you incorporate the requirements that are optional and that can lead to bonus points? c)   Since you will now likely have more than 50 requirements, apply the magical number 7+/-­­2 rule and create a hierarchy of requirements, with at least two but no more than three levels. d)   Implement your requirements in a document (e.g. Excel, Word …) or in a relational database (e.g. Microsoft Access …). Use hyperlinks to show traceability between requirements where appropriate. 
4.   Margins Allocation Identify which of your requirements are most uncertain in terms of your ability to satisfy them? a)   Allocate reserves (margins) to those requirements in your requirements document and justify these margins. b)   Also, identify for each requirement how it will later be verified. Grading Rubric and Time Commitment 
1.   Paper Critiques    Read the following two papers by Prof. Edward Crawley et al. and by Prof. Maria Yang on  system architecture, and the relationship between different creativity techniques and design outcomes and provide a 1-­­2page written scholarly critique of each paper (what is the paper about? What do you agree with? What do you disagree with? What does it mean for your team?). The papers have been posted online.

2.   Concept Generation    Consider the concept generation and creativity techniques discussed in session 
3.   OPM Diagram and Sketch For one of the concepts generated in step 1 create an Object-­­Process-­­Diagram (OPD) either by hand, using a graphics program, or OPCAT. The emphasis of the OPD is to show the functions (ovals) and how they map to elements of form (rectangles). If you think it is important show which states are affected by the processes. The key is to show the function-­­form mapping of one of your concepts at a high level. If needed you can go to two levels of decomposition (but probably not more than two levels). Show any obvious “chunks” or modules in your concept, i.e. portions of your concept that are tightly coupled within. In addition to the OPD, create a narrative text that describes the essence of your concept and provide a visual sketch (does not have to be CAD at this point, there is research showing that going to CAD too early limits creativity) depicting your concept. Note that the concept you show in this step does not have to be “down-­­selected” from the larger set you produced in step 
4. Here we simply ask you to pick one possible concept that has the potential to satisfy the technical requirements. 
1. Pugh Matrix [30 points]  Create a Pugh Matrix to score the concepts you generated in A3 through concept  brainstorming. The criteria you apply to score the alternative concepts should be mapped to your requirements set from A
2. After doing the Pugh Matrix process once, consider rejecting your most inferior concepts and repeat the process by adding some hybridized concepts that combine some of the best features of your best concepts (however a single pass through the Pugh Matrix is perfectly fine). Document your Pugh Matrix and  comment on its conclusions.      
3. The utility of an individual architecture should be closely correlated to the score you would expect that the architecture could generate in the Cansat 2016 competition, but also the amount of effort it would take to build and complete the design (cost in terms of labor time or effort and money). You could also include your assessment of the level of risk. Given the amount of time available to complete this assignment the models you use will have to be simple. Document your Multi-­­Attribute Utility analysis and conclusions.   1

7.  Input incidence angle profile (cosine of angle taken) The solar array input vector was chose to range from one to four meters in increments of one meter.  After running masterloop, Figure 8 and Figure 9 were generated from the module outputs.  Figure 8 illustrates the mass and costs for various designs in the design vector.  The red dots indicate designs where the energy in the system dropped below zero, indicating  that  the  energy  storage  capacity  is  insufficient.    These  designs  are  therefore invalid, and are not considered part of the final answer.  The blue dots indicate designs where energy conditions were successfully met.  The data can be seen as 14 “columns” of data, which correspond to the 14 different storage designs.  The flywheel storage design is  the  2nd  column  from  the  right.    The  bottom  four  dots  per  column  that  are  grouped diagonally represent the range of solar array sizes for a specific solar array type. Depending  on  the  power  input  and  incidence  angle  profiles,  the  number  of  valid  and invalid designs can change.  For some profiles, all flywheel designs were determined to be invalid.  Figure 8 shows an example outcome for a solar-array based system. Figure 
8.  Mass and Costs for Design vector according to the input Power profile for a solar array source system. Figure  9  illustrates  the  mass  and  cost  for  an  RTG  and  storage  system.    There  are  only eight  discrete  RTG  designs,  and  this  results  in  eight  regions,  each  centered  about  one RTG design.  If more RTG data were incorporated, a more distinct Pareto front could be achieved;  however,  the  results  show  that  for  certain  RTG  designs,  the  higher-mass options become invalid. Figure 
9.  Mass and Costs for Design vector according to the input Power profile for an RTG source system Future Work There  are  several  ways  to  expand  this  module.    The  database  of  storage  devices  and source  devices  could  be  expanded.    We  have  included  several  types  of  secondary batteries and eight RTGs; however, the design space could benefit from a larger selection of solar array types.  The current module implemented only three types of solar arrays to keep  computation  times  down  while  running  the  module.    One  type  of  flywheel3  was included  in  the  design  space;  however,  if  additional  flywheel  storage  devices  emerge, they should be added to the design space.  Additional storage and source types such as fuel cells, nuclear generators, and thermoelectric converters could add to the design space, but the more options added, the slower computation will be. Additional  work  includes  incorporating  the  mass  and  power  draw  from  power distribution  systems,  such  as  a  Direct  Energy  Transfer  (DET)  or  Peak  Power  Tracker (PPT) system. The  spreadsheet  of  sources  and  storage  devices  includes  the  sizes  of  the  storage  units, however they were not used.  A future design could include this data and output the size of  the  storage  units.  This  could  be  used  by  a  possible  structures  module.    The  heat generated by the power system consists of additional calculations that could be made to link up with a possible thermal subsystem. Subsystems  which  would  act  as  inputs  to  this  power  module  include  orbits,  and environment.  Environment  already  has  an  input,  the  form  of  the  Solar  Intensity,  but additional  data  could  be  added.    The  Orbits  subsystem  has  an  effect  on  the  Effective Intensity, and on the Power Input profile. References

4.  2D contour plot of gravitational potential in the rotating reference frame It has been proven in theory and in application that there are periodic orbits about the unstable Lagrange points (no special treatment is required for the stable L4 and L5 points, once there).  Since there is no closed form solution for the equations of these orbits, computational and numerical analysis are used to determine the trajectories.  Also, these orbits can not be described by specific orbital parameters (orbital elements) as is common for typical orbits, but there are “families” of orbits that exist.  “As early as 1963, Boudas computed 19 families of three-dimensional periodic orbits in the circular restricted three-body problem.”6  Though there are many names and different methods of organization, there are 3 main categories in present literature (note that not all orbits can be classified into one of these types, however these are the most practical and well-studied orbits): 
5) Here M1 is the larger body.  It is important to note also that, in the normalized unit system of these equations, the angular rate of the two bodies about the barycenter has been set to unity, resulting in a unit of time (TU) that is the inverse of the mean angular rate.  That is: &θ= 1 1TU  =P1 s n  2π = (Eq.

1.  Orbit  transfer  takes  place  purely  by  provision  of  additional  energy  by  the  propulsion system.  No plane change is considered. 
2.  Shapes of initial and final orbits are circular. 
3.  Both initial and final orbits are assumed to satisfy all components which affect possibility, duration,  and  efficacy  of  satellite  mission,  such  as  launch  windows,  radiation  effects, earth convergence and others. 
4.  The  dry  mass,  mdry,  (excluding  the  propulsion  system  mass)  is  fixed.  The  power subsystem mass have a fixed mass, although its crucial influence on comparison between electric propulsion systems are noted.  Propulsion  systems  can  be  broken  down  further  with  different  propellants  and  associated  Isps. cold gas systems are excluded because of the combination of low thrust and low Isp. In general, cold  gas  systems  are  not  applicable  to  orbit  transfers  even  for  satellites  that  are  extreme sensitivity to contamination and/or for which the complexity of the propulsion system is of an issue. Approach Flow chart below shows the outline of out approach procedure.    The  correlation  between  orbit  and  propulsion  system  is  complementary  for  each  other.    The velocity  change  calculated  from  initial  and  final  orbits  selects  propulsion  systems  such  that achieve that value.  On the other hand, propulsion system with a certain velocity change budget constrains  the  types  of  orbital  maneuvers.      Calculation  starting  with  certain  assumptions  and releasing those assumptions as variable later is required to get out of this loop relationship.  In this  MATLAB  code,  we  commenced  the  calculation  with  propulsion  system  and  associated achievable velocity change limit as inputs, and checked its validity with velocity change obtained from transfer orbits later.  Propulsion System Type  Mass Assumptions: Maximum total mass, Fixed dry mass Calculate  -  Maximum impulsive V∆ achievable  V∆ max Initial Orbit Final Orbit Given  V∆ max Decide applicable Transfer Orbit Types Propulsion OrbitHohmann Transfer Elliptical & Hyperbolic TransferHohmann Transfer SegmentsSpiral Transfer Transfer Time, and total  V∆  Calculate required propulsion mass to achieve  V∆  Propulsion Iterate  Propulsion mass including Tank  STEP 1: Compute the maximum ∆V available. To  calculate  the  maximum  velocity  change  achievable  and  the  maximum  firing  time  by  a propulsion  system,  Impulsive  Maneuvers  for  Orbit  Transfer  is  considered.    For  most  orbit transfer calculations, each ∆V is assumed impulsive given the thrust is “relatively” high. That is, with high thrust capability, an infinitesimal time is necessary to achieve the necessary ∆V, and as such, we can approximate the burn as an impulse. If the thrust is relatively low, however, the maneuver will require a finite amount of time.  Figure 1 illustrates the case in which the burn time is finite. In such case, the thrust vector is not along the flight path and results in gravity loss as shown by the second term on the right hand side of Eq. (

Once propulsion system type has been chosen and the necessary ∆V  budget is determined, we can compute the necessary propellant mass mprop from the rocket equation:  V∆g I0 sp=propmm edry  where Isp is the specific impulse of the propulsion system chosen, g0 is the acceleration due to Earth’s  gravitational  force  at  the  sea  level.  Note  that  in  general,  the  true  dry  mass  mdry  is unknown since the propulsion system mass is unknown among others. Thus, this number has to be estimated in the beginning and must be updated as better estimate of the dry mass is generated.  (
8) m− dryNow  with  the  propellant  mass, we can calculate the mass of the propulsion system. Once the propulsion system mass is calculated, the dry mass must be updated and the whole process must be iterated until it converges to a desired level of confidence. Chemical  We could go through a detailed analysis to determine the mass of a chemical propulsion system, such as monopropellant and bipropellant systems. The analysis, however, become very complex and  tedious.  Furthermore,  there  are  many  detailed  design  choices  required  to  compute  the propulsion system mass. While such tool would be great for future use, we take a very simple approach  to  approximating  the  chemical  propulsion  system  mass.  That  is,  we  assume  that approximately 85 ~ 90% of the system mass is the propellant mass [5]. Pressurant, tanks, lines, fittings, components, etc. contributes to the remaining 15%.   (

1) Here Rs  is the vector from the center of the Earth to the spacecraft, and is assumed to be much, much larger than the distance from the center of mass of the spacecraft to any other point on the spacecraft.  The quantity µ is the gravitational parameter of the Earth, and I is the moment of inertia tensor for the spacecraft.  When the body frame of the spacecraft is defined to be along the principle axes set, this equation expands toii: M 1  − = M 2  = M 3  − = Rs 3R 3 s 33µsinθ sinθ 2 cosθ  (I  − I 22 )3µ cosθ cosθ sinθ2R 3 s 333 22(I 11  − I 
2)  Here  M1,  M2,  and  M3  are  the  torques  about  each  principle  axis,  I11,  I22,  and  I33  are  the principle  moments  of  inertia,  and  θ1,  θ2,  and  θ3,  are  the  Euler  angles  that  describe  the orientation of the body frame with respect to an equilibrium position, in the notation of the authors.  This is further simplified into a single axis equation by John S. Eterno in SMADiii to: T  =g 3µ2 R3 I  − Izysin(  θ ) 2 (Eq.
3)  Where Tg is the maximum torque, Iz is the largest principle moment of inertia and I  is thesmallest, and θ is the maximum deviation of the z-axis from the local vertical.  While perhaps a more detailed analysis could be achieved by using Equation 1 or Equation 2 in this analysis, the simplicity of Equation 3 and the result of a maximum gravity gradient disturbance torque make it the preferred equation for this report. ySolar Radiation Solar radiation pressure is a result of the transfer of momentum from photons of light to the surface of the spacecraft.  The result of this pressure across the spacecraft surface is a force that acts through the center of pressure, cp, of the spacecraft.  In most cases, the center of pressure  will  not  be  on  the  line  from  the  center  of  mass  of  the  spacecraft  to  the  Sun (particularly  for  nonspherical  spacecraft  that  change  their  orientation  with  respect  to  the Sun), and thus a torque will be generated around the center of mass, cm.  For Earth-orbiting spacecraft,  where  the  distance  from  the  spacecraft  to  the  Earth  is  small  compared  to  the Earth-Sun  distance,  the  mean  solar  flux  acting  on  the  spacecraft  is  considered  a  constant (regardless of orbital radius or position).  In general, the solar radiation torque is found to be much smaller than the other environmental disturbance torques, and is frequently neglected. Spence  derives the force due to the solar radiation pressure to be: ir F  − = Fe  A cosθ[ (1− C  )sˆ + 2(C  cosθ+ 3 Cd )nˆ] c s 1s(Eq.

1.  Given  the  power  requirement  over  the  mission  lifetime,  the  power  subsystem  (solar arrays and batteries) mass depends on the orbit. 
2.  The amount of data a spacecraft can transmit depends on the transponder bandwidth of the  communication  subsystem  and  the  amount  of  time  over  which  a  specified  set  of ground stations are visible to the spacecraft.   The mission may also require a specified amount of data transmission.  Furthermore, the power and communications subsystems impose additional mutual constraints on  one  another.    The  power  required  by  the  spacecraft  depends  on  the  communications subsystem design and the duration of its use.  Using the trades between the Orbit, Power and Communication  Subsystems  as  guidelines,  ranges  of  orbit  size  and  inclination,  sizes  of  solar arrays and batteries, and communication subsystem power usage as well as antenna size can be found and optimized.  Problem Statement:  What combination of orbit size and inclination, solar array and battery sizes, and communication subsystem power usage and antenna size yields an optimal solution given a specified ground station downlink site?  The objective is not to model each subsystem to a high fidelity, but rather to better understand and model the mutual dependencies of the subsystems.  Approach:  A program will be written using Matlab and STK.  The program will use information input by the user to compare different combinations of orbits, solar array and battery size, and communication subsystem power needs and antenna size.  The program will then output a set of optimal ranges for each of the subsystems.  A more detailed description of our approach is found in the Solution section.  Solution:  The inputs include the amount of data that needs to be transmitted and a predetermined fixed data rate.  This data rate was mentioned in SMAD to be approximately

We will allow the data rate and coverage time to vary to calculate mass of the data storage and visualize the relationships. Calculation of Quantity of Data Transmitted: D = R(FTmax – Tinit)/M  (
1.  As one can see, radiation damage occurs with protons energies greater than 10 MeV and electrons with energies greater than 1 MeV, which is the regime that will be considered in this report. . Table 1: Effects of Different Particle Energies on the Spacecraftiii During the 1960’s, a great deal of work was done to understand how the Van Allen belts vary with position and time.  NASA created two programs, AE8 and AP8, which calculate the electron flux and proton flux, respectively.  Both AE8 and AP8 have versions corresponding to solar minimum and solar maximum data.  During a solar maximum, atmospheric density increases which causes the protons at lower altitudes to collide with the atmosphere, which decreases the proton flux.  Therefore, the code corresponding to a solar minimum is generally used as a worst-case approximation.  It is important to note that the models developed by NASA have been criticized for inaccuracies.  Some important reasons for discrepancies in the models are that the radiation environment, especially at high altitudes is extremely dynamic.  Since the calculations are based on a 1960 magnetic field model, they are not necessarily representative of the environment today.  In addition, the models only predict solar minimum and solar maximum variations, without accounting for how the radiation varies over the 11-year cycle iii. Although other programs have been created to more accurately represent the radiation environment of the Van Allen belts, none have been shown to be completely successful and the NASA models AE8 and AP8 are still the most widely used method for calculating the radiation environment iii. The NASA model calculates the electron and proton fluxes as a function of energy, L-value and the ratio, B/B

1. Schematic diagram of Environment Control and Life Support System [Lawson, 2003] 5 Various  methods  can  be  used  to  compare  technologies  when  designing  an  ECLSS  system.    The NASA/MSFC and McDonnell Douglas Method uses eight trade study parameters to compare the available systems:  mass,  power  consumption,  volume,  resupply  (for  shorter  missions),  development  potential, emergency operation, reliability and safety.  The method implemented here is based on NASA’s Equivalent System Mass (ESM) metric that expresses mass, volume, power consumption, cooling requirement and crew-time requirement in terms of a so-called “equivalent” mass.  Development potential, emergency operation, reliability and safety are considered in selecting the technologies to compare via the ESM metric and are not expressed quantitatively.  ESM is often used as a transportation cost measure in studies comparing Advanced Life Support Systems (ALS) since the cost to transport a payload is proportional to its mass [Levri, 2003]. In this analysis the power subsystem is being studied in detail, so the ESM equation has been modified to remove  the  power  equivalency  factor.  Instead,  estimated  power  consumption  is  determined  for  each subsystem  and used as an  input into the power module.  Further  analysis follows the discussion  of ESM, although power values are included in description of ECLSS options for comparison purposes.  ESM* refers to the version of ESM without power equivalency (Equation

Schematic diagram of Environment Control and Life Support System for a Mars Transfer Vehicle using ALS Technology [Stafford, 2001] Air Revitalization Subsystem –ISS The ISS air revitalization subsystem can be broken down into three main components: a CO2 removal system, an  O2 generation  system  and  a  trace  contaminant  control  system  (TCCS).    The  function  and  operation  of various implementations of these subsystems are discussed in detail in previous work as well as in [Lawson, 2003] and will not be explained in detail here.  C02 removal on the ISS is accomplished via a 4-Bed Molecular Sieve (4BMS), electrolysis is used to generate molecular oxygen from oxygen-containing compounds available in the spacecraft (Solid Polymer Water Electrolysis SPWE), and the ISS Baseline TCCS system uses activated carbon to remove non-combustible gases and bacteria filters to remove particulate [Hanford, 2003].

4. Comparison of ESM* for ISS and ALS Systems CHALLENGES FOR A MANNED MARS MISSION A manned flight to Mars also embodies a host of new safety challenges.  For one, given the long duration of a mission  to  Mars,  there  is  an  increased  chance  of  failure  of  dynamic  systems  such  as  pumps,  valves,  and electronics.  These failures may be caused by the increases in operating times, on/off cycles, structural flexing, corrosion,  and  abrasion.    Secondly,  there  is  no  opportunity  to  receive  equipment  or  supplies  from  Earth, underscoring the need for reusable, robust systems.  A third challenge is the increasing communications lag between the transportation vehicle  and  Mission Control  as the vehicle  approaches Mars.  Once in a Mars orbit, this lag will vary from eight to forty minutes depending upon orbital positions.  Data rates will also decrease dramatically, on the order of 10-6 compared to Earth orbiters.  One obvious challenge facing the power system is the reduction in available solar energy as the vehicle approaches Mars.  In fact, the power available to solar array will decrease by 50% from the start of the mission. CREW SIZE Given the length of the mission and probability that injury or illness will be suffered by crew members at some point in time, it is required for at least two crew members to be trained in performing each mission critical task.  Given a review of the literature on this subject, we assume that six astronauts will be adequate to meet the mission requirements.     P O W E R  For long-duration manned missions it is critical to provide continuous high power while minimizing cost.  In this  problem  set,  we  considered  two  energy  production  devices,  solar  cells  and  radioisotope  thermal generation (RTG).  Solar arrays can provide power at low specific mass and cost, but are subject to eclipse periods and day-night cycles (insignificant for Earth to Mars transfer).  Solar arrays also require an energy 14 storage device to meet  the continuous  power requirement.   Radioisotope  thermal generation  is a compact system that can provide continuous power for a long duration. However, additional mass is required with the RTG system to provide crew safety from nuclear radiation. Energy  storage  devices  are  necessary  for  non-continuous  power  generation  and  to  provide  an  emergency source of power in continuous systems.  For human space flight, it necessary to have a low specific energy density while minimizing cost.  Chemical batteries and flywheels were deemed to meet cost, reliability, and technology-readiness requirements. To simply the analysis, a modified version of an existing tool, PowerDesignResult.m, developed by Chung, Hilstad, and Kwon of

2) where P, M, and rad are the inputs described above, and Tensile_strength is the tensile strength of the material being evaluated.  Next, the yield load and the thickness required to withstand it (t_yield) is calculated:   Yield_load = (P + 2M/rad)*SF_yield  [N]  t_yield = Yield_load/(2π*rad*Yield_strength)  [m]                   (

7)         (
8) where t is the greater of the yield and ultimate thicknesses, φ is a geometric parameter, γ is a reduction factor, and Young is the Young’s modulus of the material.  The value obtained for P_buckle must be less than that found  for  Ultimate_load.    If  this  is  not  the  case,  the  thickness  is  increased  in  small  increments  until  this constraint is satisfied. ThermalNot all materials are reasonable to use when thermal effects are considered.  Whether or not a material will satisfy the thermal constraints is determined using the code thermal.m.  It returns a ‘1’ if the design is feasible, and a ‘0’ if it is not.   To determine whether a design is feasible, the absorbtivity and emissivity of the shell material is needed.  If a one-layer shell is used, the absorbtivity (α) and emissivity (ε) are the properties of the material also used to support the structure requirements.  If a two-layer shell is used, the emissivity and absorbtivity is assumed to be that of the material being considered for the outer layer.   3 The thermal calculations assume that the satellite is an isothermal sphere, and that there is uniform electrical generation  on  the  sphere.    The  code  does  not  involve  maintenance  of  satellite  battery  limits;  it  could  be assumed that they have a separate control system with thermostats.   The worst-case maximum temperature (T_max_s) and worst-case minimum temperature (T_min_s) of the satellite must be found.  These equations use the following parameters: GS: solar constant a: albedo qI: earth IR emission σ: Stefan-Bolztmann’s constant RE: radius of earth ρ: angular radius of the earth, asin(RE/(altitude+RE) Ka: factor for reflection of collimated incoming solar energy off of earth, 
9)        (
10) where Q_w is a system input described above. The values for T_max_s must be less than the user specified value T_user_max and T_min_s must be greater than the user specified value T_user_min.  This ensures that the spacecraft will never reach a temperature that it cannot operate at.   Additionally, the necessary area for a space radiator is found, as an additional check that the design is reasonable.  The space radiator cools the system by removing excess heat.  It must be able to do its job of cooling but be a reasonable size to fit on the satellite.  It is assumed that the radiator will be placed at a 90 degree angle from the sun so it will not face the sun.  Also, it is assumed that the radiator does not absorb IR emission from the earth or albedo from the earth.  The area of the space radiator A_r is:  A_r = Q_w/(σεT
11) where T is the average of T_user_max and T_user_min, which is assumed to be the approximate average operating temperature of the spacecraft.  If the area of the space radiator is less than the surface area of the spacecraft, and the maximum and minimum temperatures are valid, then the design is feasible.  Cost Satellites have a wide array of components that contribute to their cost. Fortunately there are Cost Estimating Relationships (CERs) that are mathematical expressions that relate a characteristic of a satellite component to either its cost or the cost of another component. CERs are used in the code SATELLITE_COST.m in order to calculate the cost of the small satellite with thermal characteristics calculated previously.  The thickness of the shell was found in calculations of the other subsystems.  From the previous calculation for the thickness 4 of the shell, the mass of the shell can be found using the density of the material(s) used.  The mass of the structural components is then used in order to determine the cost of the entire satellite. Two mass CERs are used to determine the cost of the satellite. The first CER is in two parts: the Research, Design, Test, and Evaluation cost (RDT & E) and the Production cost (Production). The second CER comes from the Aerospace Corp. Small Satellite Cost Model Ver 
12)        (
13) The results are summed together to get the total cost of the satellite. The second CER used is from the Aerospace Corp. Small Satellite Cost Model Ver.
14) The mass for each CER is changed according to the design, resulting in a satellite cost for the single and double layer designs. Once the cost of each design is calculated, the resulting value is set as the cost of the first unit of production. Next, the learning curve is applied in order to calculate the cost of the next N-1 units of production, along with the average system cost.  Note that this code itself outputs a structure with a variety of the cost data; not all of this information is output from the tool.  If more detail is desired concerning the satellite cost, it can be found by running this code separately and examining the output structure SATELLITECOST.    CONCLUSIONS Several examples cases were run to prove functionality and demonstrate trends.  In all cases, the load P was set to 127500 N, the moment M to 294200 Nm, the altitude to 700000 m, the electrical dissipation Q_w to 170 Watts, the maximum temperature T_user_max to 350 Kelvin, and the minimum temperature T_user_min to 200 Kelvin.  All of these values are similar to those used in examples in the textbook.  The number of satellites to be produced was set arbitrarily to 10; so values output for cost represent the cost of 10 satellites.  5 To easily get the cost for one, the tool could be run with ProductionNumber set to

3.  Artificial Gravity A  manned  mission  to  Mars  requires  that  the  crew  be subjected  to  the  space  environment  for  a  significant period of time.  A travel time of nearly one year would result in significant musculoskeletal deterioration of the crew  members  if  the  transit  period  were  completely zero-g.14  This would result in the crew members being physically incapable of performing much work, if any, when they arrive at Mars.  The  downtime  as  a  result  of  the  crew’s  required physical  rehabilitation  would  dramatically  reduce  the available time on Mars for the crew to perform valuable research activities.  In order for the crew to be productive when they reach Mars,  an  artificial  gravity  of

6.  The reason for this design is to increase the amount  of  electromagnetic  force  in  the  system.    The center spacecraft increases the electromagnetic force by 17  times  the  force  produced  by  the  outer  spacecraft.  The  result  is  that  the  three  spacecraft  design  contains EMFF coils that are 17-
7) gdes2maxω Here  rdes  is  the  radius  that  is  ‘desired’  by  the  system given  the  desired  force,  gdes,  and  the  maximum allowable  rotation  rate,  ωmax  (ωmax  is  determined  by human factors).  If the calculated radius is larger than the minimum radius allowed by human factors, then rdes can  be  used  to  calculate  the  tether  length.    If  not,  the minimum  radius  is  used  and  the  rotation  rate  must  be slowed  accordingly.    Assuming  that  the  two  payloads are equal mass, the tether length for this system is then twice the desired radius.  The tension in the tether may be calculated as:   T =2ωdesmr  (
8)  Here T is the tension in the tether, m is the mass of one payload, and rdes and ω are as above.  This is simply an expression of Newton’s Second Law, where the radial acceleration is calculated as the radius times the square of the angular velocity.  The axial stress equation can then  be  used  to  calculate  the  required  cross-sectional area to support the tension T, given the ultimate tensile strength of the chosen material.   A=  (

10) tether  design  requires  a  different The  multiple calculation  of  tether  length, but  similar  techniques  are used  to  compute  the  final  mass.    From  Figure  1  it  is clear that the multiple tether system is overconstrained.   6For a system of tethers in tension this is not necessarily a bad thing, it simply makes analysis more tedious.  For example, the multiple tether system would maintain its shape  (while  spinning)  if  it  consisted  of  either  the spokes or the rim tethers alone.  However, if only the spoke tethers were used, there would be a small risk of collision  between  the  pods  during  spin  up,  etc,  so  it might be wise to include the rim tethers.  The solution to  this  problem  is  to  analyze  these  systems  separately and add the results.  Allowing the angle between two spokes to be α, and the angle between any spoke and its adjacent rim tether to be β, it is clear that:    = nα π2(
11)  Here n is the number of spokes.  The pods are each at distance rdes (or rmin, whichever is larger), as calculated above, so the total length of the spokes, ls, is n times r.  The total length of the rim tether, lr, can be calculated as:  lr =2nrsin()α2 (
12)  The tension in the spokes is calculated without the rim tethers in place as:  Ts =2ωmr  (
13)  The tension in the rim tethers is calculated without the spokes as:   T =rβcos   (
14) Ts2 The area and mass of the rim and spoke tethers can then be calculated as before for each type of tether, and the results added for total tether mass. The following table gives examples of total tether mass for various systems.  Systems labeled ‘tether’ are single tether systems, while systems  labeled  ‘mult-n’  are  multiple  tether  systems with n pods.  The subscript r represents the rim tethers, and the subscript s represents the spoke tethers.  To get the total tether mass for a mult-n system, add the spoke mass  to  the  rim  mass.    For  single  tether  systems,  the mass of both pods is 70,000 kg, and for mult-n systems the individual pod mass is taken as 40,000 kg.   is included in 261 261 127 149 127 149 the  implementation  of

16)  Here v is the required velocity of the spacecraft in the transfer  orbit,  µ  is  the  gravitational  parameter  for  the central body (the Sun), and r1 and a are as above.  The required change in velocity can then be calculated as:  vV−=∆cv  (
17)  Where  ∆V  is  the  required  change  in  velocity,  v  is  the required spacecraft velocity above, and vc is the circular velocity  that  the  spacecraft  already  has  due  to  the orbital motion of the Earth, given by:  cvµ=1r  (
18)  The required ∆V in the solar frame is only half of the calculation,  however,  for  it  takes  extra  fuel  to  escape from the Earth’s sphere of influence.  The ∆V required in  the  solar  frame  can  be  considered  the  “hyperbolic excess  velocity”  that  is  required  in  the  Earth-centered frame, or the speed that the spacecraft has with respect to  Earth  as  it  leaves  the  sphere  of  influence.    The change  in  velocity  required  from  a  low  Earth  parking orbit can be found by first calculating:  vi=v∞µ2+cr  (
19)  Here  vi  is  the  insertion  velocity  that  is  required  from LEO, v∞ is the hyperbolic excess speed that is required in the heliocentric frame (the ∆V solved for above), and rc is the radius of the parking orbit where the spacecraft is holding until departure.  For this study, rc was taken to  be  200km.    The  required  ∆V  is  then  calculated  as above, where vc is recalculated for the parking orbit in the Earth frame.  For  the Hohmann  transfer  from  Earth  to Mars  studied here, the required change in velocity in the solar frame (v∞)  is  calculated  as  
20) thruster location  Here  mp  is  the  mass  of  the  propellant,  mo  is  the  dry mass  of  the  vehicle,  Isp  is  the  specific  impulse  of  the chosen thruster, and g is the acceleration due to gravity at  the  Earth’s  surface  (where  Isp  is  defined).    For  this study,  a  value  of  350  seconds  is  assumed  for  the specific  impulse,  a  typical  value  for  a  bipropellant chemical  thruster  [see  Ref  23,  pg  692].    Thus,  for  a given  spacecraft  dry  mass,  the  required  fuel  mass  can be determined for each structural design.  Note that the required fuel masses to insert the desired payloads into Mars  orbit  are  quite  large,  so  it  is  a  reasonable assumption to ignore the thruster hardware at this stage of  analysis.    Additionally,  for  potentially  massive components such as fuel tanks, all of the systems under consideration will have similarly scaled components so the  relative  error  here  is  not  significant.    Finally,  the question  of is  not  specifically addressed  here.    It  is  assumed  that  the  Mars  transfer burn will be performed before the various designs have initiated their spin.  Thus, all tethers will be retracted, and the EMFF system will be docked into a single unit.  This  way,  the  whole  system  can  be  started  on  the transfer  orbit  as  a  unit,  and  then  the  rotations  can  be initiated en route.  Spacecraft Rotation A unique feature of the EMFF system is that it does not require  fuel  to  initiate  and  maintain  the  nominal  spin rate.    All  other  designs,  however,  will  require  some manner of  external  thrust  to  start  spinning.    It  will  be assumed  that  the  monolith  structure  has  a  pair  of thrusters on opposite sides of the wheel (i.e. at the ends of a line of diameter) to create a couple.  The single and multiple  tether  systems  will  have  a  single  thruster  on each individual pod, oriented to create a pure moment with no net force.  The selected thruster has the same specific impulse, 350 s, as the primary thruster.  Under  these  assumptions,  the  fuel  required  to  spin  up can  be  calculated  from  the  rocket  equation  above, noting that:   V ω∆=∆r  (
21)  Here ∆ω is the change in angular velocity, and r is the radius from the center of rotation to the thruster.  When calculating  the  fuel  requirement  from the  rocket equation, the total fuel requirement is the dry mass of each the  number  of spacecraft.    The  following  table  shows  example  fuel requirements for spin up for the monolith, single tether, and multiple tether systems.  In this table, both ‘mass’ and  ‘fuel  mass’  represent  the  individual  spacecraft individual  spacecraft times masses, and should be multiplied by the total number of spacecraft if total system mass is desired.

A detailed  work  breakdown  structure  (WBS)  was  not created  since  this  study  considers  high-level  concept designs  that  focus  only  on  certain  aspects  of  the mission, structural configurations.    The  cost  model  utilized  a  mix  of analogy based estimation, and parametric estimation in determining the costs of the various segments.  The cost model determines the mission cost in FY03$ by  evaluating  the  required  expenses  in  the  following categories:  Space Segment This is driven by the space segment cost factor (Scf), the program level cost factor (Pcf), the heritage cost factor (Hcf), and the space system mass, M.   The  space  segment  cost,  Sc,  in  dollars  is  calculated, after adjusting the relationship given by Reynerson, as:  S=c(PMHScfcf+)cf   (
22)  The Scf ($/kg) is the price per kg of facility on orbit. For government run, manned space programs it ranges from 38 to 157 $K/kg, with the mean being 104 $K/kg.22 The maximum value of 157 $K/kg is used in the model in order to get a conservative estimate.  The Pcf ($) accounts for the program level costs such as contractor  costs  for  system  engineering,  management, quality  assurance,  and  other  costs  that  cannot  be directly  assigned  to  individual  hardware  or  software components.  The  Pcf  was  determined the parametric  cost  estimation data  provided  in  table 20-4 in SMAD.  The heritage cost factor, Hcf, is a dimensionless quantity and accounts for the technology readiness level (TRL) costs. SMAD discusses the development heritage factor in  space  segment  cost  (pg  
23)  The  launch  cost  factor, Lcf,  is  based  on  historical  data and planned future cost goals. It is the cost per kilogram of  placing  a  payload  in  LEO  orbit.  Table  20-14  in SMAD lists the cost per kg to LEO for various launch vehicles  in  FY00$.  The  average  value  for  US  launch vehicles comes out to be

Although it’s true that If the MEAN REMAINS CONSTANT, the standard deviation will drop by 50%, this answer is not true in general. Efforts to improve the signal to noise ratio will often cause a shift in the mean. This is why identification of a scaling factor is so important in robust design. b is incorrect.

C is the correct answer.  It is very simply the definition of the F value in Taguchi methods. Note that in traditional one-way ANOVA, the F test statistic is defined differently F SSB dfBSSW dfW Where SSB is the sum of squares within treatments and SSW is the sum of squares within treatments. A is incorrect.  To compute a probability from an F test statistic, you need to integrate the F distribution over the critical region. This can be done in Mathcad with the pF function or in excel with the FDIST function. F statistics are not normally used to compute probabilities in robust design. B is incorrect.  The sum of squares due to a factor divided by the DOF of the factor is the mean square due to a factor. This is the key difference. You should note the similarity in form between the F as defined in one way ANOVA and the Taguchi use of ANOVA. Both the numerator and denominator are divided by DOF. D is incorrect.

1.  (10%) • •  What is “ideal function” in a “dynamic” system? •	 Give an example of “ideal function” in a “dynamic” system from an engineering context. A dynamic system is a system in which the desired response is defined by a signal factor. Ideal function in a dynamic system is to provide a consistent response across the desired range of the signal factor.  The response should be the same each time the product is used, under all intended operating conditions, and throughout the product’s intended life with no variation and with no harmful side effects. In an aircraft on final approach, the glide slope is set by the power and the airspeed is set by attitude.  The ideal function of an aircraft in this context is to allow the pilot to consistently determine the glide slope with throttle setting.  Unfortunately, an increase in headwind will cause the aircraft to fall below glide slope.  Accurate control of glide slope is particularly critical in landing fixed wing aircraft on aircraft carriers.  This is why aircraft carriers attempt to set a consistent apparent headwind for their pilots by varying the speed of the carrier itself. 1 of 10 
2.  (10%) •  What are noise factors? •  What is a compound noise factor? •  Under what conditions would you recommend using a compound noise factor? Noise factors are that which cause a product to deviate from its ideal function. A compound noise factor is a virtual noise factor that determines the settings of several actual noise factors that affect the system being designed.  The settings of the actual noise factors should be grouped so that they create the largest possible effect on the response. A compound noise factor should be used when the cost of experiments is high compared to the additional accuracy provided by other noise strategies.  Compounding noise may be especially important when there are a large number of noise factors affecting the response of the system.  The savings in experimental effort due to compounding noise factors rises exponentially with the number of noise factors to be considered in an experiment. 2 of 10

(10%) •	 Describe an engineering example of a system integration problem caused by insufficient robustness of the system’s components or subsystems. •	 Explain what failure modes occurred, what noise factors were involved, and how system level interactions came into play. When an electronic module is assembled onto a printed wiring board, it is essential that an appropriate amount of solder is available to form an appropriately shaped heel fillet. If the wave soldering process is not robust to variations in the shape of the leads, the ambient temperature, and solder composition, then too much or too little solder may be tinned onto the leads.  This can cause short circuits (in the case of too much solder) or poor fatigue life (in the case of insufficient solder).  The problems of poor fatigue life can be exacerbated by: •  Poor geometry of the leads due to variations in the lead forming process •	 Lack of consistent viscosity of adhesives used to bond the chip to the printed wiring board (overly thick adhesives can cause the leads to sit well above the pads on the PWB). Therefore, the process of populating a printed wiring board with electronic modules is a system integration process in which several subsystem variations combine to cause poor solder joint quality. 3 of 10 
4.  (10%) Your engineering team is involved in a product development project (imagine a project that is similar to those in your company).  You decide to apply robust parameter design techniques to a critical subsystem.  Based on the factor effect plots, you choose a set of control factor levels that are predicted to improve the S/N ratio by 12dB.  Upon running the confirmation experiment, you find that the rise in signal to noise ratio is only 6dB. •  What might have caused this difference between prediction and confirmation?•	 As the leader of the product development team, what would you do in this situation? Why? A discrepancy between the predicted and realized gains in S/N ratio can be caused by: - Anti-synergistic interactions among the selected control factor settings - Error variance in the estimates of the main effects of the control factors - Human error in carrying out the matrix experiment (e.g., failing to ensure that the proper control factor settings are in place for each experimental trial, errors in recording data or computing factor effects) There seem to be two main alternative courses of action: - Accept the gains in robustness that were achieved and move on to another phase in the development process.  After all, your team reduced the variance in the system response by a factor of four.  There may be other subsystems that can benefit from a similar effort and that can’t happen when all the team’s energy is focussed on tuning the last bit of performance from this system. - Work to improve the critical subsystem further.  One may choose to look for additional control factors that may be used to increase robustness.  Or, have the team brainstorm which pairs of control factors are most likely to be interacting.  Running an L4 on those pairs might reveal the cause of the discrepancy. 4 of 10 Questions 5-10 below refer to the following scenario: You are an engineer at ALDOA incorporated and you are concerned with the effects of precipitation heat treatment on the yield strength (Y) of a new aluminum alloy.  Customer surveys indicate that perceived quality loss is inversely proportional to the square of Y. You wish to determine the effects on Y of the following control factors: Oven temperature (high, medium, low) Oven size (small, medium, large) Position of the specimen in the oven (on the floor, on a low rack, on a high rack) Aging time (short, medium, long) Quenching liquid (water, oil) Quenching liquid temperature (high, medium, low) 
5.  (3%) Which signal-to-noise ratio would you use to guide the design?The larger the better S/N ratio will guide you to minimum quality loss as defined above.

1. Less of a scholarly look into the root and foundational issues faced by NASA’s brass, and more of a motivational speech-style segmentation of core leadership dilemmas than any manager of a large-scale project might face, Webb draw upon his considerable experience in governmental and civilian enterprise to seek out the commonalities universally found in large-scale projects everywhere.  Ranging in focus from doctrine vs. best practices, to society and the democratic process, to management and leadership in changing conditions, to the virtues of a flexible and adaptive organizational structure, Webb peppers his general musings on these topics with stories from his own career to illustrate his thoughts and evidence these examples as microcosms of his broader points.  He naturally writes a good deal about NASA, still only 10 years old at the time, but other programs featuring prominently in his oratory.  He discusses as a large-scale complex system the lead-up planning for World War II and notes that the organization and coordination of a war on a mass scale, and the subsequent advances by America during that time, are indicative of our “government by crisis”, perhaps a condition inherent in a democracy.  While Apollo and the space program in general may have been midwifed by the Sputnik and Gagarin crises of American technical confidence, it would have been exhausting to conduct the entire decade-plus of the program in a state of extreme alert and panic; rather, according to Webb, a “multidisciplinary, large-scale effort” must be “more deliberate, more carefully planned, and more interrelated to a multitude of important activities than crisis conditions permit.”  He also spends considerable lines considering the lessons garnered from the Polaris missile program, the New Deal’s Tennessee Valley Authority, the Marshall Plan for post-WWII reconstruction, and the postwar revamp of the State Department to better serve the nation in the face of a complex and changing world.  In these examples, he evokes remarkably modern and complex theories of management, speaking in turn about “feedback” and “closed-loop” systems thinking and good government stemming from good practices. Of course the most interesting parts of the text are where Webb describes his experience in forming the leadership structure at NASA.  From the first glance, the scope of the Apollo program by just the numbers is staggering.  In five years’ time, NASA had to ramp up from a workforce of 75,000 employees to one of 420,000 employees, with a “level of annual outlay [that] has averaged less than half of Sears, Roebuck; one-third that of Ford; one-third that of Standard of New Jersey; and considerably less than that of General Electric, Chrysler, Mobil Oil, Texaco, U.S. Steel, IBM, and others.”  As such, it was incumbent upon Webb to craft a leadership structure that was responsive and flexible, and that held as its watchword an unprecedented degree of collaboration with industry and universities. After mulling the characteristics of the National Aeronautical Space Act, passed the Congress in 1958, Webb details the process through which NASA built as flat a hierarchy as would be possible in such a large effort.  Asserting that the quick buildup of NASA was possible because of, rather than despite the democratic process, Webb extols the value of dissent in an organization that does not operate under a “Soviet-type arrangement” where decisions made upon high are binding and unquestionable.  Indeed, if there were any question that Apollo was a symbol for the Cold War struggle, Webb says in plain, “we are, whether we like it or not, in the midst of a crucial and total technological contest with the Soviet Union.”  The decision to include collaborators from all across the country was necessary to prove the openness of the American space program, assure a broad spectrum of support for the project’s long continuation by political time measurements, and simply to gather enough technical expertise to be able to actually complete the mission. In a system of “continuing vote-taking”, and with the space program being a completely open one for all its failures and successes for the public and world to see, the best ideas would necessarily rise to the top and strengthen the organization.  This would be an interesting claim to those who would half-jokingly suggest that the centralized NASA decision-making process indeed proved the superiority of the Soviet political system, but it no doubt has its merits. Though, for example, John C. Houbolt did have to work through extraordinary means and use unconventional channels to promote his ideas about Lunar-Orbit Rendezvous, the fact that the idea did end up being championed at the highest levels does suggest an unusual degree of flexibility and merit-based anti-stodginess in an organizational structure.  Such relatively novel measures would be necessary in what has been called “by far the largest program of its kind ever undertaken by a democratic society in peace time.”2 This is a book about management of large-scale projects, one of which might be space-related, rather than a book about the space program and how management may be a component. While it has references to work by C.S. Draper, the majority of the authors referenced are names such as de Tocqueville, Toynbee, Ambrose, and the Bureau of Budget.  In Launius’s categorization, this would probably fall under “Policy History and Analysis” but really is a look all its own into the assuredness before affirmation into the right way to lead an organization to break new ground, and do so based in American principles and values. word count: 1484 2 Wolff, Harold.  “The Impact of Science on Society.”  American Behavioral Scientist, Volume X, Number 9 (May

2) with a man, and 
3) to return him safety to Earth, would tragically injure not only his memory but also the political gain America was to claim by beating Russia in the quest for a manned lunar landing. Accompanying the political pressure was economic pressure caused by the toll that dedicating money to the moon caused.  Within America, there was a struggle for money across many fronts such as the Vietnam War and social programming.  This economic pressure demanded that the vast sums of money spent to go to the moon would ensure a victory, a safe victory.  The need for assured success ushered in the idea of a network capable of real- and full-time monitoring.  Lindsay sells this decision in one sentence, “The global and planetary nature of the missions meant that the mission control centers needed to keep in contact with their spacecraft, especially at high activity periods such as landing on the moon” (page 
1.  The control system will now be able to respond to error as necessary 
2.  The control system will be able to scale gains as a result of the instantaneously changing LSAM mass 
3.  Gimbal elimination results  in  a structural  mass savings for, and smaller structural  stress placed on, the LSAM This section discusses the above three advantages in detail.  It also discusses the current status of the technology, as it is currently not available in production today. Error  Response:  Using  a  fixed  position  main  engine  in  concert  with  throttleable  RCS thrusters allows the main engine to be used for large trajectory corrections and reserves the RCS system for orientation correction.  Due to the magnitude of the main engine impulses, it would be difficult to use the main engine to make small corrections without inducing new error.  By using a  throttleable  RCS  system,  the  control  system  will  be  able  to  correct  for  current  error  in  a continuous  manner  as  opposed  to  an  impulsive  manner.    This  ability  will  make  the  controller more robust to error which will improve landing accuracy and help ensure Team Crimson’s goals regarding landing precision.  Continuous Scaling of Gains: The control system is designed such that system gains will continually be scaled based upon system feedback.  A throttleable RCS system that can respond to feedback by simply changing the gains will be more responsive than one that must respond to feedback by issuing new commands as in the case of a throttleable main engine.   Structural Mass Savings: According to a technical memorandum NASA published during the  days  of  Apollo,  each  RL-10  descent  engine’s  gimbal  system  has  a  mass  of  about  33  kg (approximately  twenty-five  percent  of  the  engine’s  131  kg  dry  mass)  [18].    Removing  this system  entirely  from  the  Team  Crimson  LSAM  frees  up  132  kg  of  mass.    Additionally, elimination  of  the  gimbaling  system  from  the  ascent  main  engine  will  also  free  up  additional mass (scaled proportionately to the RL-10 engine based on thrust alone, the gimabling system of the  ascent  engine  therefore  has  a  mass  of  22  kg).    Elimination  of  the  entire  gimabling  system therefore frees up over 150 kg.  This also significantly reduces the structural stress of the LSAM  11 due  to  its  now  less  impulsive  state.    A  twenty-five  percent  decrease  in  structural  mass  is proportional to that amount of loss in force on the LSAM.  Simply put, stress is proportional to force, so it will experience an equivalent amount of structural relaxation.  This technology is not yet available for the next manned lunar landing mission, but Team Crimson has taken great thought in how such a system would perform.  As mentioned earlier, the use of LOX/CH4 as the RCS propellant allows for higher reliability of the system as well as less insulation necessary to continually cool the system due to its high boiling point.  The propellant would be fed through a Rockwell SE8 family engine.  This engine was chosen because it has, in its design, an ablative cooling method [16] where cooler gases flow over the engine wall surface and lower the boundary layer temperature to help cool the system.  This technology has actually been  proven  effective  as  it  was  used  for  the  Apollo  command  module  thrusters.    The  system would  also  have  to  utilize  some  sort  of  active  control  of  combustion  instabilities,  which  is already feasible on small engines [19].  According to Frank Lastrina, design engineer of aircraft engine  combustion  modules  at  General  Electric  Aircraft  Engines  in  Lynn,  MA,  this  sort  of control would utilize ―an AC fuel oscillation on the DC fuel flow with the intent to have the fuel flow oscillation and the heat release associated with it, out of phase with the pressure oscillation.  This theoretically would cancel out the base instability‖ [20].  Since  the  days  of  Apollo,  throttleable  engine  technology  has  been  used  more  and  more often,  thus  improving  its  reliability.    Keep  in  mind  also  that  the  first  time  these  throttleable engines were used on an LSAM, they performed without fail (during the Apollo moon missions).  The concept is tried and true.  Forty years later, it is possible to take this technology to the next level and develop it for use on RCS thrusters.  The combination of LOX/CH4 and the Rockwell SE8  engine  make  this  concept  all  the  more  possible.    Throttleable  engines  have  proven  their worth  as  evidenced  in  the  Apollo  missions,  and  the  active  controlling  necessary  to  turn  this developmental  technology  into  production  technology  have  already  been  utilized  in  small engines.  A study into throttleable engines for a larger thrust range were also studied in 1993 [21] but unfortunately the study was cut short due to funding termination.  Yet the conclusive results of the study thus far indicated that, although there is no performance advantage to such a system compared  to  pulsing  engines,  there  is  also  no  performance  disadvantage.    For  all  the  reasons mentioned in this paragraph as well as having a comfortable ten-year timeframe to develop the technology, Team Crimson highly recommends further study into this innovative concept as its  12 payoffs  would  be  tremendous  in  terms  of  control  and  structure  mechanics.    The  United  States would be the first  nation to  produce this new space technology; it would help  meet  the goal  to firmly establish the nation’s preeminence in space.

1)  This  problem  is  intended  to  reenforce  your  understanding  of  the  nodal  analysis  and  node­branch equation  formulation  techniques. Consider  the  following  simple  circuit. a)  Apply  nodal  analysis  to  generate  a  linear  system  of  equations  which  can  be  used  to  compute  the circuit  node  voltages.  Where  appropriate,  please  give  matrix  or  vector  entries  as  analytical  formulas in  terms  of  R1,  R2,  R3  and  Is. b)  Use  the  node­branch  approach  to  form  a  linear  system  of  equations  which  can  be  used  to  compute the  circuit  node  voltages  and  resistor  currents.  Where  appropriate,  please  give  matrix  or  vector entries  as  analytical  formulas  in  terms  of  R1,  R2,  R3  and  Is. 
2)  In  order  to  help  you  better  understand  how  to  create  a  program  which  reads  in  schematics  and generates  systems  of  equations,  we  have  written  a  set  of  matlab  functions  and  scripts  which  can be  used  to  read  in  a  ﬁle  containing  a  circuit  description  and  set  up  the  associated  nodal  analysis 1IsR2R3R1021matrix  and  the  appropriate  right­hand  side.  In  this  problem,  you  will  modify  these  functions  and scripts,  so  bear  with  us  while  we  describe  what  they  do. The  matlab  script  assumes  that  the  circuit  description  is  given  as  a  list  of  statements  in  a  ﬁle,  and that  the  element  types  are  describ ed  in  the  following  format. resistors: rlabel  node1  node2  val where  label  is  an  arbitrary  label,  node1  and  node2  are  integer  circuit  node  numbers,  and  val  isthe  resistor’s  resistance  (a  ﬂoating  point  number).current  sources:ilabel  node1  node2  val where  label  is  an  arbitrary  label,  node1  and  node2  are  integer  circuit  node  numbers,  and  val  isthe  current  ﬂowing  from  node1  to  node2 .voltage  sources:vlabel  node1  node2  val where  label  is  an  arbitrary  label,  node1  and  node2  are  integer  circuit  node  numbers,  and  val  isthe  voltage  between  node1  and  node2 .voltage­controlled  current  sources:clabel  node1  node2  node3  node4  val where  label is  an  arbitrary  label,  node1  ,  node2  ,  node3  ,  and  node4  are  integer  circuit  node numbers,  and  val  is  the  controlled  source’s  transconductance  (denoted  gm),  which  means  that  the current  ﬂowing  from  node1  to  node2  is  val  times  the  voltage  diﬀerence  between  node3  and  node4 (i.e.  i =  gm(v3  − v
3)  In  this  problem  we  will  examine  the  heat  conducting  bar  basic  example,  but  will  consider  the case  of  a  “leaky”  bar  to  give  you  practice  developing  a  numerical  technique  for  a  new  physical problem. With  an  appropriate  input  ﬁle,  the  simulator  you  developed  in  problem  2  can  be  used  to  solve numerically  the  one­dimensional  Poisson  equation  with  arbitrary  boundary  conditions.  The  Poisson equation  can  be  used  to  determine  steady­state  temperature  distribution  in  a  heat­conducting  bar, as  in ∂2T (x) ∂x2  = κa κm (T (x) − T
4)  This  last  problem  uses  the  simulator  you  developed  in  the  previous  question  to  remind  you  about some  of  the  properties  of  eigenvalues  and  eigenvectors  before  we  use  them  in  lecture.  Be  sure  to familiarize  yourself  with  MATLAB’s  eig command  before  you  start. a)  Consider  the  “leaky  bar”  system  in  question  3,  assume  T0  =  T (
1)  = 3N − 
2. b)  The  matrix  problem  for  the  resistor  line,  written  in  terms  of  the  resistance  matrix  G�1 is  G�1i =  v where  i is  the  vector  of  current  source  currents  ﬂowing  into  each  of  the  nodes, and  v is  the  vector  of  node  voltages.  For  our  original  resistor  line,  i is  a  zero  vector. Suppose  now  that  the  j­th  entry  of  the  vector  i  is  nonzero.  Physically,  an  injection  of current  into  node  j  will  cause  a  change  in  all  the  node  voltages.  The  j­th  entry  of  vector i  multiplies  only  the  j­th  column  of  G�1 .  So  a  change  in  all  the  node  voltages  in  v  will be  algebraically  possible  only  if  the  j­th  column  of  G�1  consists  of  all  nonzero  entries,  i.e. G�1 By  extending  this  argument  to  all  entries  of  the  current  source  vector  (and  all  columns  of the  resistance  matrix),  we  see  that  the  N × N  resistance  matrix  G�1  is  full,  i.e.  will  have N 2  nonzero  entries. i,j  = 0  for  all  i. c)  The  factorization  of  the  tridiagonal  conductance  matrix  G produces  two  bidiagonal  fac­tors  L and  U ,  such that  LU  =  G.  In  order  to  see  this,  let’s  examine  the  ﬁrst  few  elimination steps  for  the  matrix  G. After  the  ﬁrst  elimination  step  we  get: ⎡⎢⎢⎢⎢⎢⎢⎢⎢2 R0 
3.  will  be  strictly  diagonally  dominant 
4.  will  be  tridiagonal Thie  ﬁrst  statement  we  have  already  shown,  since  all  multipliers  except  for  the  M21  are zero.  Second  one  is  also  trivial.  Same  is  the  last  one. Now,  let’s  show  that  the  third  statement  holds.  Since  initial  matrix  is  strictly  diagonally dominant,  we  know  that  a22 > a21 +  a23 ,  and  a11 > a12 .  The  only  thing  we  needto  show  is  that  the  number  we  substract  from  a22  is  less  than  a21,  which  is  also  evident. Therefore  we  have: | | |||||||||We  have  proved  the  statement  in  general  case. a22 > a22  − a21 > a21 +  a23| − |a21 = ˜|a23|˜ | | ||||| (
1)  In this problem, you will write your own factorization algorithm based on row orthogonalization. Such  an  approach  makes  it  simpler  to  do  numerical  pivoting  and  is  more  easily  compared  to  LU factorization. a)  Write a matlab program for solving Mx  = b, where M  is square,  which is based on making the rows  of M into  a set  of orthonormal  vectors.  Please  remember  to  normalize  the rows  so  that they correspond to vectors of unit length.  You may ﬁnd it helpful to look at our qr.m  matlab program which is based on orthogonalizing columns. b)  Consider  using  your  row  orthogonalization algorithm to  solve  a  tridiagonal  matrix (a  tridiago-nal  matrix is  one whose  only nonzero  entries  are  Mi,i, Mi,i+1,  and Mi,i−

5) The channel is at a slope of angle  α, as shown in Figure 2, and the horizontal components of the gravitational force creates the pressure gradient for the downward ﬂow.  The governing equations are the Navier-Stokes equations, u · �u + �p = f + ν�2u. (

In this example we will be using the simpliﬁed potential ﬂow model of the air.  In this model the air velocity v at a point x  is assumed to be irrotational. Therefore,  the velocity  can be expressed  as the gradient  of a scalar  velocity potential u, as in v(x) = ∇u(x). If  the  air  is  assumed  to  be  incompressible,  the  air  velocity  must  have  zero divergence as in ∇ · v(x) =

1) One of the key themes in Invitations to Love is the effect of communications technologies on social relationships—and the effect of social relationships on the way those technologies are used. To explore this issue, interview someone you know (parent, relative, friend, classmate, etc.) about the way they use different communications mediums (letters, phone, texting, IM, email, Facebook…) to establish or maintain social relationships. Are some forms of communication more appropriate than others for specific kinds of relationships (e.g., with parents, professors, friends, love interests…) or for specific kinds of activities? Elicit specific examples (e.g., a text message, wall post…) if possible. Alternately, you may explore this issue by addressing the role of a particular medium in fostering a specific kind of relationship or community—but again, make sure to employ primary data.  (
2) Love stories are at the center of Ahearn’s study of social change in contemporary Nepal. Following her example, elicit a love story from someone you know (parent, relative, friend, classmate, etc.). How does this story compare to those elicited by Ahearn? What kinds of attitudes does your respondent convey towards particular cultural ideals or social expectations? What kinds of obstacles stood in the way? How does the way the narrative is structured claim or deny agency? A key to doing this kind of interview (and to ethnographic interviewing more generally) is asking open-ended questions so that respondents are able to structure the story according to their personal priorities or preferences.  (
3) Interview someone you know (parent, relative, friend, classmate, etc.) who is a non-native speaker of American English residing in the U.S. about his or her linguistic views, experiences, and practices. What are this person’s views about the different languages s/he speaks, and when it is appropriate to use one language or the other? Are there things that can’t be translated between the languages, or different views of the self associated with using one or another language? Is speaking English liberating or constraining? Does this person ever consciously (or unconsciously) switch between 	  1	  languages when talking to other bilinguals? Do any “language ideologies” emerge from this interview? The interview need not be conducted in English.  (
4) Working with a parent or older relative if necessary, draw a kinship diagram of your own family that extends back at least to grandparents’ generation (it doesn’t have to be complete, but do your best). Identify relatives with kinship terms from EGO’s perspective (i.e., yours) in whatever languages are used within the family. You may have to develop conventions for representing phenomena we did not cover in class (for starters, put an X through a deceased figure; a dotted vertical line represents adoption; ≠ represents divorce…). Reflecting on your own experience, what categories of kin are most important and why? What functions do different kinds of kin play? How does your experience of kinship (in terms of things like descent, marriage, caregiving…) reflect your particular cultural background and/or historical circumstances (such as migration or diaspora)? You may wish to adapt your diagram to better illustrate the particularly issues you want to discuss, but provide a key to make it legible. Alternately you may perform this exercise with a friend, relative, or classmate, diagraming his or her family back to grandparents’ generation, and interviewing him/her about the relevant significance of different kin relationships.  (
5) Kulick argues (in his both his articles on Brazil and Gapun) that gender is not an innate personal attribute, but rather a set of learned qualities that are performed or displayed. Pick an arena or setting of gendered self-display to study through participant observation, interviewing, or the collection and analysis of cultural artifacts (a website, a magazine). Describe how people organize their activity in this arena to conform to gender ideals, to challenge those ideals, or both. More specifically, you might look at the way particularly styles of speech, communication or language use connect to gendered identity, for instance in an Internet forum devoted to stereotypically male or female interests, or within a community that challenges prevailing gender norms (like Bronies, for instance). 	  2	  MIT OpenCourseWarehttp://ocw.mit.edu21A.00 Introduction to AnthropologySpring 2013   For information about citing these materials or our Terms of Use, visit: http://ocw.mit.edu/terms.
1) Chose a form of expressive culture to study anthropologically. You will recall that we defined expressive culture as specialized activities of manipulating symbolic forms to produce absorption, create meaning, and enact identity (not necessarily in that order), and identified it in a variety of arenas: performance, ritual (secular and sacred), art, verbal art, music, body adornment (including fashion), material culture (like architecture and the built environment), food… Thus you have an almost limitless array of possibilities. You may want to pick a form of expressive culture you know well, or something you don’t know anything about (yet). The challenge is to identify how if creates meaning and enacts identity for people who produce and consume it. How does this form of expressive culture promote social cohesion or create social difference? Are there conflicting understandings or interpretations surrounding it?  I have a suggestion that might be particularly timely and potentially beneficial to people outside our class: In the wake of the Boston Marathon bombings, there has been an outpouring of emotion, sympathy, and support conveyed through the medium of expressive culture (ritual, art, music, memorials…). Using what we know about expressive culture, examine how the role it plays in confronting and addressing the aftermath of this violent, traumatic event. If there is sufficient interest, I suggest we make this a group (or even class) project in the form of a website that will live on once the semester is over. If you are interested in this topic, please email me so I can coordinate the group project. Also, it will be imperative to begin conducting research immediately since these events are unfolding rapidly.    (
2) Observe an instance of knowledge transmission, either formal (a class or lesson) or informal (such as a club). How is the instruction organized? How do experts and novices interact? What is the relationship between the transmission of knowledge and skill and social/cultural reproduction? What are people learning (or gaining) besides the explicit object of instruction? Does the organization of instruction/pedagogy reflect specific cultural priorities, themes, or ideas about personhood, subjectivity, or are available at MIT and throughout the area (e.g., http://www.boston-capoeira.com). In this case, does the experience reflect Downey’s discussion? authority?

The kind of pleasure that they proposed was controlled and planned, and directed toward male passion.  
9.  Pious pleasure and the image of an “ideal man.” 
10. Compares Iran’s puritans with popular Islamists – deepens the analysis.  
11. Cultural politics of young people in post-war Iran in the 1990s. Shows another paradox: the globalizing Iranian youth, however, did not abandon their religion. They reinvented their religiosity in a new way that suited their interests and aspirations, but also redefined and subverted the constraints of the existing codes and norms. (The author calls this subversive accommodation).  
12. Fun vs. “hooliganism” and such…(the negative side of fun in an absence of authorities in general within and outside Islamic context).  
13. Where does the anti-fun-damentalism come from? (historical and comparative analysis) 
14. The basis for the fear of and battles against fun in contemporary times. This smoothly shifts into the conclusion.  
15. Conclusion – concentrates on the meaning of the fun and answers the question that has been posed in the beginning of the article. MIT OpenCourseWarehttp://ocw.mit.edu21A.01 How Culture WorksFall 2012   For information about citing these materials or our Terms of Use, visit: http://ocw.mit.edu/terms.

1) Pick a topic that brings the advantages of your material (your field notes) in alignment with your interest. You can choose to write about inequality, the relationship between the animate and inanimate, the rush hour, the lunch time crowd, inclusion/exclusion, social borders vs. physical ones, enclosures, front porches, social and other hierarchies of importance, commercialization of space, and other ideas that your field notes might evoke. Read your notes carefully. They are the key to everything. Without extensive notes this project is not possible.  (
2) Define the kind of paper you want to write. The fact that you need to apply the analytical lens of two thinkers shapes your paper in conceptual and structural ways. Here are some suggestions, although far from exhaustive.  -- You might consider doing a comparative paper. This means that you give an equal weight to the two thinkers, and examine the ways in which they attend to the same problem or question from their respective theories.  -- You can use one more extensively while using the second as a foil against whom you highlight the ideas of the first. For instance, if Geertz really helps you to do a thick description of a phenomenon that puzzles you (i.e. people tend to congregate on this side of the street and not on the other; or there is a relative absence of people on a block that is crowded with all sorts of buildings), then apply his theory and method. Use the other thinker (in this case Foucault) to indicate why Geertz was a better choice for this particular analysis. For instance, tell how Foucault would have illuminated the issue and what would have he left out, or have done differently, and why.  -- You can write your paper in a form of a debate between Geertz and Foucault. What would they want to argue about your block?  Who would win the debate? Why? Do you think you could intervene and make suggestions to both thinkers about the advantages and flaws in their theories?   1(
3) You are also required to engage with at least two readings from our course in addition to Geertz and Foucault. This is not to make your life more difficult. Quite the contrary, once you engage with some of the writers who have done what you are asked to do, you will automatically find your argument. That is how most scholarly articles are written. They respond to what other anthropologists have done before by agreeing, disagreeing, and mostly by enriching, tweaking, and expanding on others’ work. You can easily imagine that without referring to previous research, scholars would end up talking past each other, reinventing the wheel, and never being able to build on each other’s discoveries and accomplishments.    (
4) Your papers should contain all the parts that make an analytical paper. It should have an argument, appropriate ethnographic descriptions that help to illuminate your point and encompass complexity, and a conclusion that both strives to address the complexity and reaffirms your argument in an in-depth manner.  Here is an example of a complex argument by Caldeira, whose article we read for the class. Caldeira concludes her paper with the following argument. (I paraphrase it here). The young men in Sao Paolo are engaged in the act of resistance through their specific forms of mobility and creation of visual display. Through them they assert their presence in the city that marginalize them. When viewed within the context of these men’s marginalization and oppression, their acts of resistance are legitimate and justified. However, they are also disruptive when we look at them within the larger context of the city that is striving to become more secure and democratic. Instead of improving democratization and opening the city to diversification, these men end up amplifying the sense of danger and thus contribute to the fragmentation and inequality of Sao Paolo in a new way beyond the existing inequality between rich and poor.  Galdeira’s argument is complex because (

5. 	Papers will be handed back one week after you hand them in, so if you ask for an extension, the entire process will be extended. Your revision is due a week after you get your first draft back.  If scheduling with the writing tutor becomes difficult, let me know and we’ll extend the deadline. You must tell me the new deadline you are requesting. A “first draft” of a paper does NOT mean that you can hand in a “rough” draft.  It needs to be as finished as you can possibly make it, which includes proper citations, date, title, numbered pages (!!), correct spelling, logical structure, introduction and conclusions, etc., etc. If you have questions about proper citation practice, consult any of our readings. Avoid long quotes.  If you must include one, any quote that takes up more than 5 lines needs to be indented.  But far more preferable is to paraphrase, which is perfectly fine so long as you cite your source.

1.  What question or questions do you address? 
2.  Why do these questions arise? From what literature or real-world events? Offer background that clarifies your questions and puts them in context. 
3.  What answer or answers do you offer? Summarize your bottom line in a few sentences. 
4.  How will you reach your answers? Say a few words about your sources and methods. 
5.  What comes next? Provide a roadmap to the rest of the paper: "Section I explains how I began my life of crime; Section II details my early arrests; Section III describes my trip to death row; Section IV offers general theoretical conclusion and policy implications." Something of that sort. Number 1 ("What is your question?"), number 2 ("Why does this question arise?"), and number 3 ("What is your answer?") are essential: make sure you cover them. Numbers 4 and 5 are optional. Summary introductions of this sort help readers grasp your argument. They also help you diagnose problems with your paper. A summary introduction can be hard to write. A possible reason: gaps or contradictions in your arguments or evidence, which summary exposes. Solution: rethink and reorganize your paper. CONCLUSION FORMAT Authors often recapitulate their argument in their conclusion; however, a good summary introduction often makes a full summary conclusion redundant. If so, recapitulate quickly and then use your conclusion to explore the implications of your argument. What policy prescriptions follow from your analysis? What general arguments does it call into question, and which does it reinforce? What further research projects does it suggest? 1ARGUMENTATION      Four injunctions on argumentation should be kept in mind. 
6.  Write from an outline. Outlines are major aids to coherence and readability. 
7.  Write at a level appropriate for college undergraduate readers--i.e., smart readers without too much background knowledge on your topic. In fact your class papers will be read by teachers who probably know something about your topic, but they want to see how you would lay out your argument for folks who don't. For more advice onwriting, see William Strunk Jr., and E. B. White, The Elements of Style, 3d ed. (New York: Macmillan, 
1. State the main thesis of your paper at (or near) the beginning: say, in the first paragraph. It is not bad to say something like: "I will argue that ...." If you do not have a thesis, get one. 
2. Stay focused. Your papers should critically assess some important aspect of one of the theories we have been discussing: the thesis of your paper, stated near the beginning (see point 1 above) will say what that aspect is. Before you get to the evaluation you will need to describe the relevant aspect(s) of the theory you are assessing. But do not try to provide a comprehensive overview of the theory. Instead, guide your presentation by the particular problems that animate your paper. For example, if you are writing on John Rawls’s “difference principle,” you should not first try to sketch his theory of the original position and the argument for the principle within the original position. Confine yourself to the aspects of Rawls’s view that are of immediate relevance to his account of fair distribution. Anything else will be a distraction (and in the short space available, will be done badly). 
3. Do not lead with (or conclude with, or otherwise include) sweeping generalities: "Rawls's theory of justice is the most important recent contribution to the perennial human search for the ideal society." "Since Plato, philosophers have sought out the meaning of justice." "For thousands of years, human beings have searched for truth. “Philosophy is based on reason, not rhetoric.” (What about: “Man is born free, but is everywhere in chains.” If you are Rousseau, then you can break any rule that I have stated here.) Such remarks add nothing of substance; indeed, they subtract by distracting from the issues at hand. Moreover, they suggest that the writer is unsure what to say, and is looking for a way to fill some space. You do not want to create that suspicion. So just get right to the point. 
4. Write clearly. That's easier said than done, and hard to make operational. But you can make a first step by writing short sentences, avoiding page-long paragraphs, and being careful to signal transitions. Operationally: If a sentence goes on for more than (say) 5 lines, find a way to divide it up; if a paragraph goes on for more than 20 lines, find a way to divide it up; if your paper falls into sections, make sure to include a sentence or two of connective tissue between the sections. Moreover, put things as simply as you can. Writing philosophy does not require elaborate formulations, esoteric words, purple prose, neologisms, or polysyllabophilia. In a poetry course, things would be different, but in this course, 1your writing should focus readers’ attention on the ideas you wish to express, not to the words you have chosen to express those ideas. 
5. Do not make the writing boring and clumsy, even if it is clear. Introduce some stylistic variety. For example, do not start every sentence with the subject. Moreover, stay away from passive constructions: instead of "The wheel was invented by Joe," why not: "Joe invented the wheel." Do not have too many sentences that begin “It is...” or “There is....” Though such constructions are sometimes appropriate, overusing them slows things down. Avoid long strings of prepositional clauses. And try not to repeat the same words (unless, by repeating the same words, you are aiming at emphasis). 
6. Support assertions. When you attribute views to the person whose ideas you are addressing, indicate the evidence for the attribution by noting relevant passages. But you need not include quotations. As a general rule, you should only quote a passage if the passage plays an important role in the paper (say, it is a passage that you will want to be able to refer back to at various points in the argument), or if you think that there is some controversy about whether the philosopher actually held the view that you are attributing to him or her. Do not submit a paper that strings together lots of quotations. 
7. Take the views you are discussing seriously. The philosophers we are reading are not fools. If, as you describe the relevant parts of their views, you find yourself attributing foolish views to them, assume you have misinterpreted. (Perhaps you have not. But treat “misinterpretation” as the default setting.) One strategy for taking a view seriously is to “argue against yourself”: ask yourself how the philosopher you are criticizing would respond to your criticism. Try to get “inside” the conception you are discussing; develop a sense of its internal integrity, and see if you are able to understand how someone (who is neither a moron nor a sociopath) might have come to hold the views in question. The books and articles we are reading are the product of sustained reflection, over a long period. The authors often distributed drafts of their manuscripts to other people, and then tried to incorporate responses to the objections they received. The result is not that their views are right, or genuinely coherent, or nice. But you can be sure that they have greater depth and coherence than you may suspect on first reading. 
8. When you finish writing, read your paper out loud. Writing that does not sound right will not read right. Applying these rules of thumb will require that you spend some time editing your papers after writing a first draft. But the additional time will be worth it. Your papers for this course will be better than they would otherwise be, and you will eventually start to edit as you write. 2MIT OpenCourseWarehttp://ocw.mit.edu21A.218J / WGS.170J Identity and DifferenceSpring 2010For information about citing these materials or our Terms of Use, visit: http://ocw.mit.edu/terms.

If, as you describe the relevant parts of their views, you find yourself attributing foolish views to them, assume you have misinterpreted. (Perhaps you have not. But treat “misinterpretation” as the default setting.) Specifically, ask yourself how the philosopher you are criticizing would respond to your criticism.

The books and articles we are reading are the product of sustained reflection, over a long period, by very smart people. The authors often distributed drafts of their manuscripts to other smart people, and then tried to incorporate responses  to the objections they received. The result is not that their views are right, or genuinely coherent, or nice. But you can be sure that they have greater depth and coherence than one notices on first reading.

Moreover, put things as simply as you can. Writing philosophy does not require elaborate formulations, esoteric words, purple prose, neologisms, or inversions of the natural order of words. Your writing should draw the attention of readers to the  ideas you wish to express, not to the words you have chosen to express those ideas.

1.  We began this section of the class with readings and lectures focusing on the history of learned magic in Europe: alchemy, astrology, and necromancy in particular. What is the role of learning in the Faust material we've read and heard – do these various versions of the story really engage with the idea of the learned magician, and how? (NOTE: If you think Faust's learning simply a pretext to get the story going this probably won't be the right topic for you). What are the possibilities attached to learning? What are the constraints? Where is learning positioned in society? What are the trade-offs associated with learning? Then there's magic. Is it reliable or not? Real or illusory? Natural or demonic? Permitted or forbidden? Obscure or easy? You might also think about how the figure of the learned magician has evolved over the intervening centuries: what issues and questions from Medieval and Renaissance magic are still present for us today, particularly in the techno-scientific context we inhabit at MIT?         
2.  Liszt, like Verdi, condenses a complex literary text into the interplay between three rich characters: here, Faust, Mephisto, and Gretchen/Marguerite. Pick a piece of text that you feel sums up something important about one of the characters. Begin with that exercise: explain (of course) why this passage strikes you as important, and use close reading as a way into talking about the ingredients that make up the character you've chosen as your focus. As this character moves through the story, and migrates from Goethe to Murnau or Liszt, what changes and what stays the same?        
3.  Does the Gretchen material simply hijack the story about ritual magic, and turn it into something else? Perhaps there’s a way of thinking about Gretchen as the “outside” of learned magic – and thus, in relation to it, helping define it in terms of what it excludes. As we learned from Tara Nummedal, not all alchemists were male. Yet the social context of Renaissance education in its communal and public forms (schools, monasteries, and universities) was almost entirely masculine.

1.  Avoid contractions in formal writing.  In informal writing, they’re OK.  
2.  In formal writing, never use the second person as a substitute for impersonal or general references.  Thus you should not write:  “living in a democracy makes you less likely to be arrested for political reasons”.  You might write instead: “Democratic governments are less likely to arrest their citizens for political reasons.”  
3.  Do not use an impersonal pronoun (e.g., “it”) when its referent is unclear or nowhere in sight.  The “it” should refer clearly to a specific noun used in the preceding clause, not to a general concept contained in the previous clause, nor to a specific noun two or more clauses away.    Similarly, avoid using “this” and “that” as subjects or direct objects.  Thus, you would not write: “Dahl and other scholars have advanced the argument that democratization depends little on international influence. But this ignores important exceptions, such as Greece, Argentina, Taiwan, and the Eastern Europe.”  Instead, write:  “Dahl and other scholars have advanced the argument that democratization depends little on international influence. But this argument ignores important exceptions, such as Greece, Argentina, Taiwan, and the Eastern Europe.”      
4.  If you use the first person (“I” or “we”), stick with it throughout; do not switch back and forth between impersonal presentation of your argument and the first person singular.  Thus, you might write:  “In the first section of this paper, I discuss the reasons for the collapse of Chilean democracy in 
5.  “It’s” is a contraction of “it is”.  “Its” is the possessive of “it”.  As you will not be using contractions in formal writing, you won’t ever use “it’s”.  
6.  Do not use “and/or”, as in “they fought for God and/or country”.  Instead, you might try “they fought for God, country, or both”.  
7.  Be careful not to use “which” when you mean to use “that”.  Use “which” when the phrase or clause set off is parenthetical to noun it qualifies.  Thus, you would write: “U.S. pressure pushed the Salvadoran government toward democracy, which it probably would have favored in any case.”  By contrast, use “that” when the phrase or clause it introduces is integral to the noun described.  Thus you would write: “U.S. pressure pushed the Salvadoran government toward the kind of democracy that Salvadoran civilian leaders were already promoting.”  
8.  Avoid the passive voice (e.g., “it was done to him”) where possible.  
9.  Avoid using “while” in the place of “even though” or “although” – that is, as a mushy substitute for “but” and “and”.    
10. If your first language is not English, check for common mistranslations.  For instance, if you are a native speaker of Portuguese or Spanish change you should make sure to write “make decisions” instead of “take decisions”, “soccer” instead of “futbol” or “football”, “commitment” instead of “compromise”, “sensitive” instead of “sensible”, etc.   
11. Do not worry about split infinitives.  If Captain Kirk can do it (“to boldly go where no one has gone before”), so can you.  
12. If in doubt about style and grammar, consult Strunk and White1 or some similar volume.  
13. Always include page numbers on your papers.  
14. If your footnotes are abridged or you are using the academic journal style of including citations in parentheses, be sure to include a list of references cited.   Make sure the formatting of you bibliography and references corresponds to one of the appropriate styles.  Stick with ONE style and use it throughout.  If in doubt about formatting issues, consult the Chicago Manual of Style.  
15. For your first paper, allow at least two hours after that paper is completely written to your satisfaction to go back through it and check to make sure that you have covered all these points.  For subsequent papers, check both for these points and for any hints you have received on previous papers.  
16. Spell check and proofread your paper before handing it in.    
17. Spell check and proofread your paper before handing it in.    
18. And lastly, proofread your paper before handing it in.                                                                  1William Strunk Jr.,, E.B. White, and Roger Angell, The Elements of Style, 4th Edition (Boston: Allyn & Bacon, 
1.  Practice.  
2.  Get in and get out gracefully. •  Make sure you have a good opening and closing line •  Provide an orienting context, a reply or follow-up to what someone else has just said, an acknowledgement of the previous speaker, etc. If you are part of a team, conclude with a good hand-off to the next speaker •  summary. 
3.  Give a roadmap of your presentation:  (
4.  Organize your presentation in a format that makes them easy to absorb – e.g., 1, 2, 3,  
5.  If the presentation is to be longer than a few minutes, use visual aids to orient and engage your audience.  Slides are often better than handouts, as there is often a danger that the audience will start flipping through the handouts noisily, distracting others and sometimes themselves.  For the graphical presentation of data, consult Edward Tufte, The Visual Display of Quantitative Information, 2nd Edition (Cheshire, England: Graphics Press, 
6.  Where possible, invite questions and audience participation.  If you think you might be pressed for time, however, make sure to wait until you have finished your presentation to take questions.  
7.  If your will be interrogated or cross-examined afterward (for example, if you are presenting to an academic audience or a legislative oversight body), anticipate the questions that you may be asked and come with prepared answers.  If you do not like the question and cannot answer it, say why it’s the wrong question, explain what the right question is, and answer that one.  
8.  Practice.  
9.  Practice again.  
10. And finally, PRACTICE!   *****If you want to sound smart but are not slated to present, prepare a question on the materials to ask at the appropriate time.*****

1.  Gabriel García Márquez’s fictitious village Macondo is often described as a microcosm of Latin America.   Which features does García Márquez portray accurately?  Which does he exaggerate?  Which does he downplay or ignore altogether?   
2.  Next week you find yourself talking with an acquaintance who has recently returned from vacation in Mexico.  She remarks (boorishly) on how poor the country seems in comparison to the United States and how weak the rule of law seems to be.  The reason, she feels, is that Mexicans have a different attitude toward time, civic responsibility, and financial dealings.  As she puts it:  “They are always talking about mañana, and everyone is on the take.”  What sort of an explanation is this for underdevelopment and authoritarianism in Mexico?  Do you agree with this perspective?  What other explanations might you offer for relative poverty and weak rule of law in Mexico?  
3.  Evaluate the following statement:  “Neoliberal democracy in Latin America is either a farce or a fraud, a comedy or a tragedy, depending on one’s perspective; it is certainly no cure for the region’s ills.  The real problems that average Latin Americans confront – poverty, corruption, abuse at the hands of an indifferent state – remain unchanged.” Potential ID items 20 IDs will be drawn at random from

Where possible, discuss the kinds of evidence the different authors consider and the ways they interpret it.  As with other topics, concentrate on the main points and do not get lost in the detail.   
1. social conflicts and value conflicts concerned with economic change, social mobility, charity, and dependence 
2. gender roles and accusations against women.  (Do not base your answer solely on Levack’s weak discussion of this topic.) 
3. images of witchcraft in learned demonology, their evolution, differences from the witch fears of ordinary people and consequences in witch hunting.  How demonology was developed and interpreted by scholars, lawyers, and religious leaders.       
4. the nature of evidence and legal procedures and political controls or lack thereof over witch trials 
5. how witchcraft fears expressed or were influenced by tensions and changes in the world of the accusers 
6. the cycles or processes or stages that witch-hunting went through, the kinds of events that set them off, and the place of resistance and skepticism 
7. the relative importance of elites and ordinary people, in terms of witchcraft beliefs, pressure to prosecute witches, and the actual carrying out of witch trials  In lectures and class discussions I introduced material not found in the readings and which in a number of instances contradicts or qualifies the readings.  You are responsible for this class material, at least for the most important points, though not all the detail.  In your essay, precision and specificity about ideas and facts matter.  Better to go back to your sources (readings, class notes) than to be vague or sloppy.  Cite your sources specifically.  You do not have to accept everything your sources say (even lectures).  The more you can discuss the material critically, showing original thought, the better. 
1.  A  number  of  contestants  (16  in  all  the  cases  studied)  are brought together to compete against each other for a common reward.  
2.   A challenge is introduced.  
3.  The  contestants  are  normally  divided  into  groups.    In  most cases  studied,  the  groups  were  divided  into  groups  of  8,  but The  Swan  was  a  notable  exception,  where  the  16  contestants competed in groups of 
4.  The two teams compete each week in smaller challenges, with the object of eliminating a player.  
5.  Elimination  is  usually  carried  out  by  a  vote  or  personal decision.

7.  A final, “ultimate” challenge takes place between the finalists (2 in most cases, 8 in the case of The Swan).   
8.  A winner (the “hero”) is selected and rewarded.  This order of events is conserved throughout the programs, and is thus the backbone of this genre of narrative.

3. TURN ON the VCR power - insert video and push the stop button (the video may begin to play automatically otherwise). 3 V I D E O   D I G I T I Z I N G  Using iMovie OPEN iMovie by clicking on the program icon at the bottom of the screen or going to the Apple menu. You should be prompted to start a new project folder when the program opens.  If you are not prompted to start a new project then there may be an open project on the computer.  Close the project from the file menu and then select New Project. Select New Project.  Name project folder and  temporarily  save  it  on  the  computer desktop.  If you are not prompted to open a new project go to the File Menu and select New  Project  from  the  drop  down  list. Name  this  folder  and  save  it  to  your desktop. The iMovie window will now open.  Push Play on the VCR.  You should now see the movie playing in the recording window on the left of the screen. If you do not see your movie check that the Input/Edit slider is pushed to the left – toward the camera icon. At the bottom center of the recording window you will find the iMovie controllers.  Click on the  Import  button  to  begin  recording  your video.  Click  on  the  Import  button  again  to stop recording.  Push Stop on the VCR.

4) to play the clip.  Note: if you are having any problems viewing the clip make sure that the Eye simple (left) is selected and NOT the clock. As the clip plays you will notice the movie play head below that follows each frame. The play head also displays the play time of the movie.  Use your mouse to click on the hash marks on the bottom of the timeline and small gray triangles will appear.  Note: You  must  click  and  drag  on  the  hash  marks  for  the  triangles  to  appear.  Use  the triangles to crop out sections of your clip.  Drag  one  triangle  to  the  left  to  set  the beginning point of your clip.  Drag the other triangle to the right of the timeline and set where you would like the movie to end.  Click on the Play button to preview your new 5 V I D E O   D I G I T I Z I N G  clip.  This step may require some time to master – getting acquainted with cropping scenes. Once you are satisfied with the beginning and end of the movie go to the Edit menu and choose Crop.  You may also use the Delete button on your keyboard.  The extra parts of the clip will be removed.  Should you have any problems with this step you can delete the clip in the editing bag and simply drag its copy from the shelf into the editing bag to start over. Compressing & Saving Files When you are done editing Clip 1 you will need to compress it by  exporting  it  was  a  QuickTime  movie  file.  Go  to  the  File menu and select Export Movie. Select Export movie to QuickTime; set its format to CD-ROM Movie  Medium  and  click  Export.  This  creates  a  movie approximately  320  x  240  pixels.  When prompted to save your movie select your Zip  disk  and  name  the  file  something descriptive. The  compression  process  takes  some time  to  complete  depending  on  the length  of  your  clip  –  approximately  80 seconds for each 10 seconds of video. To edit your remaining clips, drag the previously edited clip back to the shelf and drag the next clip down to the editing bay.  When you are done with each clip – and each clip  has  been  saved  to  your  Zip  disk  –  choose  Quit  from  the  File  menu.  When prompted to save this project click Don’t Save.  Drag your project folder into the trash can and empty the trash.  DO NOT leave your project folder and its files saved on the computer desktop. 6 V I D E O   D I G I T I Z I N G  Importing Movie in Word There  are  two  methods  for  importing  your  movie  files  into  your  Word  document. These methods vary slightly and depend on the version of Microsoft Word you are using – PC Word or Macintosh Word.  Note: you must have QuickTime installed on your computer in order to import the files into Word.

1. The major structural changes required to bring about your much-improved or perfect family system.   
2. 
3. The important cultural changes required to ensure that a majority of people freely accept, value, and are willing to make sacrifices to maintain this utopian family system. A brief description of how these changes would be instituted—how they would come about.  In the schools?  In the mass media?  In the legislature?  Through the efforts of elected officials like the president?  In other institutions?  If you include legislation, remember that it can be state or municipal as well as federal.  While you don’t have to cite sources when describing your much-improved/utopian family system (you may, though), you do need to cite sources during the part of your paper describing and critiquing the present-day family system.  Don’t worry about the impossibility of bringing such changes to pass in 2 years.  The deadline is set at 2007 so you won’t spend too much time predicting what the country will be like.   2Your model needs to be internally consistent and logical.  The changes you make must be consistent with the information you have acquired in this class about families in the U.S. at present.  That is, if you arrange for all mothers (or fathers) to be at home taking care of their children up to age 14, then you must discuss the implications of this change regarding family income, husband-wife interaction, etc.  Discuss the larger context.  Do not speak exclusively of individual nuclear families as if each one were an island in the ocean, unconnected to the larger society.  It’s OK if your model seems unlikely to come about.  However, your model must be possible.  For example, you cannot build in Martian day-care providers or solve problems by having the federal government award each family $100,000 per child.  Your model does not have to be of the “one-size-fits-all” type.  However, if you include more than one model, you must describe each one comprehensively.  You should provide some discussion of how your model accommodates families in different social classes, minimally the middle and working classes.  Extra points if you include the upper classes and the extremely poor (sometimes called the underclass, or the “truly disadvantaged”).  7+ pp.  Please cite at least six class readings in your exposition.

4.  Mix and match any of the above, or, using materials from the second part of our course,  “Reformulating  Race:  Making  and  Remaking  the  Idioms  of  Science,” develop your own topic.  
1.  Background:  Set the stage.  Describe the situation in enough detail so that the reader has the proper and sufficient context for your analysis (e.g., place, time, setting, relational history of actors).  
2.  The Interaction:  Describe the sequence of events.  Who did what to whom, with what effect?  What was the intention, as far as you are able to know? What was the final outcome?  
3.    Analysis:    What  forms  of  power  were  operating  in  this  situation?    Was  this  something  that  would  be  expected  from  the research on power about the conditions under which people are most vulnerable and that are described in your readings or class discussion?  What forms of power were not operating and why?  How might this situation be explained by the authors you have read thus far?    Format and Grading:  Your paper should be no longer than 8 double-spaced, typed pages.  All pages must be numbered.  Any paper submitted without page  numbers  will  be  penalized  one  grade.    Citations  should  conform  to  the  format  described in L. Cuba, A Short Guide to Writing about Social Science.  Grammar and syntax should emulate the illustrations in Strunk & White, The Elements of Style.   All papers must be submitted with a copy of the first and second drafts of the paper.  No one produces only one draft of a paper. Your  paper will be not be graded if it is unaccompanied by a copy of earlier drafts.  First and second drafts vary by more than small spelling and grammatical corrections.  The second draft should be an improvement in organization, depth and detail of analysis, and tightness of organization and writing.  Your paper will be graded on the following criteria:  
4)  Organization  and  writing.  Proper  English  grammar,  appropriate  citation  (see  Cuba,  Writing  About  Social  Science),  and  succinct, clear writing style (see Strunk and White, Elements of Style for excellent advice and examples).  Your paper is due October 12 in class. Late papers will be penalized one grade per day late.  
1) The unlimited number of specimens which may be obtained at any good-sized packing plant with a minimum expenditure of time and labor.”54  Here, nearly a century in advance, we find an early version of the argument Bendixen and colleagues will leverage for the usefulness of pigs as model organisms: their presence at hand. For Lane (citing Baumgartner), pigs are “unlimited,” largely due to advances at the time in refrigerated transportation that allowed for the consolidation of pig production in major centers.  “Centralized packing plants were located adjacent to the stockyards” in most pork industry centers, so the enterprising medical supplier could acquire a significant batch of fetal pigs with a “minimum expenditure of time and labor.”55 According to Bendixen, in 2010 pigs are an “exceptionally large biological resource … [thanks to] industrial pig production…”56 In both cases, due to over-production by industrial pig farms, the size of the porcine standing reserve is trends toward infinity, or excess, while the ease of their acquisition for scientific purposes is represented as incredibly simple. For both Lane and Bendixen, the “facticity” of this reserve army of scientific pigs — the origins of and reasons for this production, its potential cancellation, factory farming itself, etc. — is taken completely for granted. As a more recent manual covering the benefits of using fetal pigs for dissection — citing Nebraska Scientific, self-billed as the “world’s largest processor of fetal pigs”57 — suggests: “Fetal pigs are not bred for the purpose of dissection. They are a by-product of the pork food industry.”58 This rhetorical move is meant to assuage potential guilt about the way that fetal pigs are acquired for dissection use, but it does so through precisely the same unproblematic acceptance of the industrial origins of “model pigs.” It depicts fetal pigs as the excess or waste of an industrial process that will continue ad infinitum,                                                          54 Ibid., 
2) The convenient size of the specimens…  (
3) The absence of an objectionable odor or other quality that would make them objects of disgust to the most “finicky” student. (
4) The impossibility of any sentimental restrictions on their use arising from humane societies or antivivisection societies. Related to this is the fact that the student has no  tender associations to be outraged as is sometimes the case where ‘pet’ animals are used. (
5) The softness of the muscular and skeletal systems in the fetal pig make easier the dissection of the nervous and circulatory systems. And finally, (
6) The student gets a very good idea of the course of the fetal circulation in mammals.59   (Emphasis mine) Lane was, clearly, incapable of predicting the situation that fetal pig dissection finds itself in today: actual fetal pigs are being replaced by “cyber” dissections or other substitutes because “finicky” students of multiple varieties (religious, ethical, etc.) have, in fact, made these pigs into “objects of disgust”;60 and “sentimental restrictions” from “humane societies” like PETA have  arisen.61 He was wrong on both “moral” counts. However, those later shifts — toward a more cosmopolitan lab makeup, toward a stronger animal rights lobby — were far removed from Lane’s foresight, and it would be unfair to fault him for failing to anticipate PETA and cyber pigs.

1. A person found with 500 grams of powder cocaine will likely receive a 5-year prison sentence. A person found with just 5 grams of crack cocaine will serve the same sentence. This policy is unfair to crack cocaine offenders and must be rewritten. The federal government argues that the addictive nature of crack cocaine and violence associated with its sale are valid justification for the sentencing disparity. These explanations provide no compelling reason to create the enormous difference in mandatory minimum jail sentences for nearly identical drugs. There are also blatant racial undertones in this policy. The large majority of people sentenced for crack cocaine trafficking or possessions are black while the majority of users are, in fact, white
2. Powder cocaine offenders are much more racially integrated with roughly equal parts white, black and Hispanic. Thus, this policy is creating a racial divide in the number of minorities sent to prison and it is obvious that the sentencing procedures are racially                                                  1 The Sentencing Project. “Crack Cocaine Sentencing Policy: Unjustified and Unreasonable.” http://www.sentencingproject.org/pdfs/
3. The psychotropic and physiological effects of crack and cocaine are, in fact, the same. Both crack and powder cocaine are stimulants, which induce feelings of alertness, euphoria, control and liveliness and they suppress hunger, boredom and fatigue. The body uses up energy reserves to give the user this feeling, which is why users often feel very sluggish, lethargic and depressed when they come down from the high and have depleted their                                                  3 Weil, Andrew, Winifred Rosen. From Chocolate to Morphine. New York: Houghton Mifflin Company, 1993, 
4. The main difference between these two forms of the drug is the method of administering each one into the body.  Powder cocaine is typically snorted into the nostrils where it is absorbed through the mucus membranes of the nose and delivered to the bloodstream. This creates a 15 to 45 minute high
5. Crack cocaine is smoked and inhaled into the lungs, where it enters the bloodstream via the lung walls. This method allows faster absorption of the drug and will allow for a more intense high that is shorter than that obtained from snorting cocaine. It will last usually between 5 and 15 minutes. Thus, the physical differences between the two versions of the drug are minimal (smoking crack can lead to some respiratory problems and snorting the powder can affect the nasal membranes as well). At best, based upon the length of the high, crack cocaine is roughly three times as intense as powder cocaine. However, the produce the same effects in the body and are therefore both classified under the same drug schedules. The major concern cited by the government in creating its sentencing policy is the level of addictiveness of each type of cocaine
6. Cocaine is a highly addictive drug. The body craves more when it comes down because of the feelings of depression and sluggishness associated with the absence of the drug. It is argued that crack cocaine, giving the user or more intense high, is more addictive than the powdered form, which provides a reason for the increased sentence time.  While it may be true that crack cocaine is somewhat more addictive than powder cocaine, this provides no rational basis for a 100:1 ratio in sentencing. There is no real way of quantifying addictiveness and the level of addictiveness is different for every user.                                                  4 Weil. Chocolate, 
7. In the fiscal year 2000 
8. David Levenson 21A.334 May 18, 2006 While there is more weapon use related to crack cocaine cases it is certainly not 100 times more, proving the excessive nature of the sentencing policy. It is unfair to use this fact as a reason for increasing 100 fold the sentences handed to users with crack. It is the judiciary’s duty to punish crack users for their possession of crack, not for the possibility of violence. It is completely unfair that a poor non-violent mother would be sent to jail much longer for buying 5 grams of crack to feed her addiction, than for buying 5 grams of powder cocaine which she could not afford. Why should she be punished for the violence of others she in no way supports? It is unjust to base a practice as serious as jail time on a perceived stereotype for which all users cannot be proven to uphold. The United States court system is set up to put the burden of proof on the prosecution. Thus, the prosecution should have the responsibility for proving violence. The current sentencing policy, however, gives a free pass to the prosecution to charge addicted crack users with violence they did not commit while not holding the same standard to offenders using powder cocaine, also a violence causing addictive drug.  Congress claims that crack cocaine is both more addictive and violence inducing than its powdered cousin. Under these claims, they feel that a sentencing disparity is warranted to more harshly punish crack cocaine users and peddlers. Their claims are outrageous and discriminatory towards crack users. The same drug should receive the same punishment. Even so, I have shown how a higher addiction rate does not justify a 100:1 ratio and how charging crack users with violence ingrained in their convictions goes against the American justice system and treats innocent people unfairly, especially                                                 8 Coyle, “Race”, 
9. It is hard to look at these figures without questioning the racial motives behind the sentencing policy.  This trend has not gone unnoticed in the United States courts. Several challenges to the sentencing policy have been made on constitutional grounds. Arguments have been set forth that the 100:1 quantity ratio denies equal protection and due process, constitutes cruel and unusual punishment, and that the policy is vague under the terms of the constitution
10. Unfortunately, these arguments have failed in federal appellate court. In the case United States v. Armstrong, a motion was granted for dismissal of a case against four black defendants convicted of crack offenses. The motion was upheld by the district and circuit court after it was found that all 24 crack cocaine cases decided in Los Angeles                                                  9 Sentencing Project, Crack Cocaine, 
11. Unfortunately, the federal prosecutor refused to comply with David Levenson 21A.334 May 18, 2006 the motion and the Supreme Court backed his decision. On the state level there has been some support as the Minnesota Supreme Court struck down their 10:3 quantity ratio on the grounds that it was unconstitutional under their equal protection clause.   Unfortunately, in this country we have stereotyped inner-city blacks as poor, violent, drug users who are a threat to society. These same stereotypes peg poor blacks as prime candidates for crack cocaine use as it is cheaper than the powdered version. Thus, to keep the violent addicts of the street the government struck using the very crack that kept the users poor. The presence of racism is especially striking when we take note of the fact that 2/3 of crack cocaine users are white or Hispanic. If this is so, then the defendants for possession of crack cocaine should roughly by 66% white or Hispanic. Whites and Hispanics make up only 
12. The policy David Levenson 21A.334 May 18, 2006 that is meant to deter and rehabilitate is actually worsening the condition. These inmates are being unfairly incarcerated for extensive amounts of time. They are actually receiving less help than they need as time goes on.  There is also evidence that drug use actually increases in prison
13. Because of the close quarters within which inmates live and the stress and depression associated with prison, many inmates will turn to drugs to ease their suffering. An Irish study of prison inmates and drug use reported that 20% of drug users actually began their use while incarcerated
14. Incarceration approaches uselessness if there is no reform of the prisoners when they leave. It is even less useful if they start using drugs or increase their use in the prisons. And because the crack users are sentenced for much longer than powder cocaine offenders they have a much longer period within which they can become even more addicted to the drug and unhealthy. This is unacceptable and must be dealt with, firstly by reducing the sentencing guidelines and prisons must then, also be reformed.  Several reasons have been given for the justification of the 100:1 ratio and they have all proven unfit as validation for the program. It is an unfair, racist program, which provides no efforts for reform and even hurts offenders chances for recovery. What then, should be done to fix these problems? There have been many efforts over the years urging congress to reduce the 100:1 quantity ratio and treat crack offenders fairly and equally with powder cocaine offenders. The United States Sentencing Commission was established in 1984 to develop sentencing guidelines to recommend to congress for                                                  12 The Sentencing Project. “Drug Policy and the Criminal Justice System,” http://www.sentencingproject.org, 
15. The commissions study advised congress to lower the ratio to at most 20:1 in their original report and has since recommended this or lesser ratios several times; all have been rejected by congress.  Congress will not listen to the heavily researched recommendations set forth in a report by a committee they created. There are clearly bigger issues at stake here, such as the racism and class issues discussed above. The ratios suggested by the committee still gave congress the power to punish crack offenders more harshly than powder cocaine defendants. The recommendations support the unfairness and excessive nature of the 100:1 quantity ratio and looks to equalize how offenders of the substances are viewed under the law. In 1997, the sentencing committee recommended a 5:1 ratio by weight and in 2002 the commission recommended increasing the amount of crack triggering a five-year mandatory minimum sentence from 5 grams to at least 25 grams. Along with this, they urged congress to repeal any mandatory minimum sentences for simple crack cocaine possessions
16. This commission has thoroughly done its research, producing several detailed reports on the reasoning behind its recommendations. It is time for congress to listen sincerely to the commission’s findings and treat crack cocaine offenders fairly.                                                  15 Sentencing Project, Crack Cocaine,

1) In his discussion of medical pluralism, Paul Brodwin has claimed the following: [T]he contest for healing power is both a product of past political struggles and a crucible for emerging forms of identity and collective action. People’s short-term maneuvers in the face of illness thus reproduce and destabilize what appear as durable structures of healing power. From the actors’ perspective – that is, from the standpoint of people seeking treatment or becoming a healer themselves – competing forms of healing propose genuinely different accounts of the body and of personal identity and morality. However, healing practices also mediate – in palpable and immediately persuasive ways – between disorders in the body/self and the body politic (from the family to the village, nation, and global system) (Brodwin 1996:

1.  Dismiss the twin myths about writing, that there are born writers and those who just can’t. Actually, clear, effective writing takes practice and feedback. You may be smart, but that does not make you a good writer. Writing skills need honing, as in any field. Remember, “Engineers who cannot write and speak well wind up working for those who can.” Your coach is here to demystify the writing process and help you improve your writing, no matter how well you write when the term begins. We will do that via your TA’s feedback, your use of handouts, short one-on-one meetings and peer editing. 
2.  When you schedule a 20-minute session with me please prepared with some paragraphs and an outline, or a draft to discuss. Bring a question about what needs strengthening, such as organizing your ideas logically, identifying a thesis for an essay (answer a question you find intriguing) or unpacking overly complex, confusing or vague sentences. Each of our meetings can be for either brainstorming or for editing. 
3.  Our goal in writing is to help you develop a sense of mastery over your writing and expression. Writing is simply a skill, like driving, and there are rules of the road, which become second nature as you practice, giving you confidence. Talking about your writing and ideas increases the complexity AND clarity of your expression. It is not enough to do it via email.  
4.  On beginning to write:  After reading and thinking,    Decide on one question that intrigues you, and that you have some feeling about. What is the answer to that question?     That is the nub of your essay, or your thesis – that is, your answer to a research question on a given topic. [Topic >> research question >> thesis or answer to Q.]   1  Write notes about 3-4 of your most important points. What evidence supports your observations?  What might your peers want to know about this question? [your audience is bright peers unaware of your subject except in a general way.]   Now organize your thoughts and evidence, outlining the points you’ll make in some logical way -- this will change drastically, if you write a good paper and edit it well.   Write a draft, revise it and revise it a couple more times (not just minor edits).   
5.  While you are writing your first draft, do not start editing, or interrupting yourself. Let the ideas, questions, points flow freely at first. Be kind to yourself. You want to A -- brainstorm first, to get your ideas down, then B – edit and reorganize sections, then C -- READ ALOUD, polish, correct and D -- read it all again revise and revise. Avoid the standard five-paragraph formula for short essays, or make them intriguing. 
6.  Effective writing is about making a sound and persuasive argument. An argument means a) expressing a point of view and understanding of an issue you have studied, b) supporting your point of view with evidence c) which you interpret for your reader clearly and persuasively.  Have pity on your reader. Anticipate points she/he may not understand, taking care to explain clearly. Then include answers to arguments your reader may have with points you make. 
7.  Generally, in your opening, you want to tell us what you will tell us and how; then tell us, (the body of your paper), using evidence, examples and arguments; and finally, tell us what you told us, why it’s important and what that may lead to (conclusion). Write/revise your OPENING paragraph LAST, since only then will you really know what you’ve done in your essay. 
8.  Once you have your major points, evidence and conclusion nailed down, construct your opening paragraph with a compelling first sentence. Now you are clear what the paper is about and your opening paragraph tells us what your question is, the answer you have decided on, and the reasons you use to support   2your argument. Support your single idea (only one per paragraph, normally) with examples, visuals, brief quotes or references to events or persons mentioned in the content you’ve studied. Include only details that bear directly on your claim or argument. The engine (power) for this paragraph is your informed conviction and the relevant detail you use to support it. The paragraph should be focused , with no irrelevant details. Two or three vivid or convincing details are better than ten, which can overwhelm. (Less is often more, when explained carefully and clearly.) 
9.  Once you have written at least one strong paragraph, keep going! Then use the best graphs as a model for the others. Be sure to open new paragraphs for each new idea; paragraphs that go on for a page usually suggest you haven’t separated ideas. Develop your paragraphs by comparing and contrasting, applying logical analysis, detailing a process, using chronology, or other methods. Don’t forget to use transitions between ideas and to lead to the next paragraph. 
10. For the first assignment, write two pages of paragraphs like the above, double-spaced.  [If the oral medium is easier for you for getting your ideas organized, record yourself on tape, then transcribe and rework your ideas.] Reading your topic sentences for each graph should lead a reader through the argument of your paper, regardless of length. 
11. Once you have your ideas and arguments formulated, write a complete draft, then another draft, then read it aloud and ask yourself:  Is my central idea interesting (do I have one?), as well as my supporting arguments, taken together?     Do I care about the claims that I’m making?    Have I stated them clearly, concisely and with vivid detail?   Be sure to use active verbs, not passive. Clarify and streamline sentences. No jargon.   Are my supporting details on point and as strong as they could be?   Have I acknowledged objections? (This strengthens your argument and respects opposing points of view.)   3  Are there any words/phrases that can be deleted? (fewer words increase power)    Did I run a spelling and grammar check? Are all awkward or unclear phrases gone? 
12. Make your style consistent and make it in your own voice. Employ words you comfortably use (not those you read – don’t try to impress, just state clear ideas, simply). Avoid abstract nouns when possible. Use concrete nouns and few adjectives, with ACTIVE verbs.  [avoid sentences like: “Abstract verbalization is symptomatic of the culture’s denial of its personal agency and responsibility.” – snore.] 
13. Once edited, your ideas should be clearly worded, with illustrative detail to support your observations.  They must be tightly constructed with no extra verbiage, awkward phrasing, errors of syntax, spelling, or punctuation.  
14. Before you do a final draft, be sure to let someone vet your paper. Use the PEER EDITING sheet or some of the ideas there. Find someone with whom you might trade favors. If you are doing an oral presentation, do a practice run (after you’ve rehearsed at the mirror) with a friend. Do not fail to apply this step. Why do we not let someone read our papers or hear our presentations before turning them in? Answers: Time constraints (plan ahead), fear of criticism (that’s how we improve), whom to ask and how (simply, with exchange), not enough sleep (do it earlier)…  
15. Finally, REVISE your paper, seriously. Keep the handout on “Revising the Draft” for reference. Examine carefully the improvements E. B. White, a professional writer, made between his third and sixth drafts of a single paragraph. Note his zippy opening line, which captures the reader. Make us want to read your paper and then hear your arguments. Finally, sum up your ideas with an engaging conclusion (and perhaps a nod to what might happen next).   4MIT OpenCourseWarehttp://ocw.mit.edu21A.461 What is Capitalism?Fall 2013For information about citing these materials or our Terms of Use, visit: http://ocw.mit.edu/terms.

1. Dad  works as a lawyer in the city, but when he comes home, he helps run the Anti-MagLev Society
2.  He uses his skills as a lawyer to his advantage. They mostly call the city and sign petitions, but every once in a while, someone does something radical. Our neighbor’s son almost got arrested last week for harassing a city contractor who came in to survey the roads. I think he stole some equipment.   1 ͼϦ͋ρ΋ήήνΧΆ Ͷ & ΈΎΧ́΋Ά ΕΉ Ώ΋͏ρΎρϋΎΧ΁ CήΧρϦΦ͏ν Ε͏́΋ΧήΠή΁ϸ͟Έ First method of resistance is opposing the   introduction of a technology into a community  2 ͭΠΎΧ͏Ά ΋Ή & ΈΎΧ́΋Ά ΕΉ ΏΙρ͏νρ ̳ρ !΁͏Χϋρ ή͙ Ε͏́΋ΧήΠή΁Ύ̳́Π C΋̳Χ΁͏͟Έ ρΎΦΎΠ̳ν ϋή ϋ΋͏ ̳ΧϋΎ-automobile societies created in   rural parts of the US, who petitioned and also used more drastic measures to stop the influx of cars    1“Alright pal, bribery isn’t getting you anywhere.

Mom’s laying out plates when I get to the dining room. Dad fumes the corner, aggressively   mixing the salad. A lettuce leaf flies out of the bowl. I reach over and pop it in my mouth.   “What did they say this time?” I ask.  “They said they want to compromise, but it’s all just cheap tricks.” I raise an eyebrow, and he continues. “They said they have a design for a new hybrid car – MagLevs and tires, all at once, so we can keep using it on normal roads here, and still get into the city. Honestly, all they really want is to create demand for the Grid. We’ll start liking these hybrids and one day, we’ll all just convert to the real things.3”   MagLev cars are fast and safe, using sensors to signal to each other. The new buildings that  come with the Grid are clean and pretty, and house hundreds and thousands more people than the squat buildings here now. The problem is that only happens after installation. Installing the Grid  in the first place is a logistical disaster. Roads are torn up and houses are demolished to clear the way for the every growing metal lattice. Dad grew up in this apartment, and he’s not about to let it go down without a fight.         The city isn’t going to let it go either. Until the whole area is converted to the Grid, the technology will continue to be a mix of botched hybrids trying to accommodate two different ways of living. Somehow, they’ll create demand until the Grid covers the region.4 *****************   Alex is my best friend - we grew up together. She’s staying in her dorm over the summer, like my brother. That weekend, I drive to visit her. The road into the city is having the Grid installed, so traffic is a disaster.5 Construction crews swarm across the highway, digging up concrete and  dragging huge metal bars into the holes. The four lane road has been condensed into one.

Construction was finished long ago, shiny buildings reaching to the sky and MagLev cars ripping by overhead. I drive carefully – my old car doesn’t have the sensor that the new cars do, so the automatic driving system doesn’t always recognize it. My dad petitions a lot against the new cars because of that. Something about “dangerous instrumentality” and liability and all kinds of other lawyer speak.6  I arrive half an hour late. Alex lives on the 76th floor. She meets me in the lobby, and we jump  into the elevator. The magnetized car accelerates upwards at a breathtaking speed. The doors slide open.      “I’ll never get over this view,” I sigh. Wall sized windows show light, wispy clouds floating  around the tops of buildings downtown. I’ll have a similar view from my dorm next semester.   “Eh, it’s not that bad,” Alex grins. “C’mon, I wanna show you what I got!” She grabs my arm and drags me to her room. She pulls a pack of cigarettes and a lighter from her desk drawer, and an odd looking set of bracelets from under her bed. She shoves it all into a faded canvas bag, and we head back to the elevator.       Once outside, we run around the building to the new park. It’s quiet and cool under the trees. We sit on a bench as Alex lights a cigarette.    “Mkay,” she says. “Check these babies out.” She rummages in her bag with one hand and holds up four black bracelets for me to see. They’re adjustable. Each has a single LED, flashing green.     I frown. “What are they?” I ask.  “Hover bracelets, duh!” She’s grinning ear to ear. “See, the light goes green when you’re on top   of the Grid. It means they’ll work.”     “Work how, exactly?” “Like this.” Alex hands me the cigarette, and puts two bracelets on her wrists, and two on her ankles, tightening the straps. She waggles her eyebrows at me and taps her fingers twice against the left bracelet. She rises into the air, giggling. My jaw drops.    6 JainΆ ΏΉ ΏD̳Χ΁͏νήϦρ ͠ΧρϋνϦΦ͏Χϋ̳ΠΎϋϸ͟Έ Hήϲ ͋ή ϲ͏ Π͏΁̳ΠΠϸ ΋̳Χ͋Π͏ Χ͏ϲ ϋ͏́΋ΧήΠή΁ϸΆ ρϦ́΋ ̳ρ ̳́νρΆ ̳Χ͋ ϲ΋ή Ύρ     responsible for accidents?  3“Wha-?” I try to compose myself. “There is no way that thing is legal.”   Alex shrugs as she floats around the park. She looks weightless. “Probably not. Then again, neither are those things.” She nods towards the cigarette I’m still holding for her. I gingerly put it out and drop it in the trash next to the bench.     “Okay, well, how does it work? Where’d you get it?” I’m bubbling over with questions.    She’s floating about on her back, eyes closed. “You know Max? He was in our anthropology class last semester? Whatever, it was him. I don’t know all the science, honestly, but long story short, they’re MagLev. It works because of the Grid!7 I heard some guy in the year above us  managed to MagLev his skateboard. Pretty sick, huh? Apparently, MagLev Corp is opening up a competition. Best unorthodox use of the Grid – you know, not the buildings and cars and stuff –  could land you a job there doing R&D!”      “Wait, seriously?”  “Yeah, it sounds like they’re trying to make the Grid more popular. You know, get input from the rest of us. 8 It pays well too. Okay, your turn.” Alex floats back down and unstrap the  bracelets. She hands them to me. “Put them on!”     I take the bands and wrap them around my wrists. Alex pulls out another cigarette.  “Hold up. You should come up with something for the competition!”  I stop wrapping to stare at her. “No way. My dad would kill me. Or disinherit me. Or both. Plus,    I would never win.”  “Please. You get straight A’s in everything ever, and I know you love the engineering classes you started taking last semester. You’re a natural!”   “I can’t. Really.” I finish wrapping my ankles and tap the left wristband twice. A smile creeps across my face as my feet lift off the ground. I feel like I don’t weight anything.       7 ͼϦ͋ρ΋ήήνΧΆ Ͷ & ΈΎΧ́΋Ά ΕΉ Ώ΋͏ρΎρϋΎΧ΁ CήΧρϦΦ͏ν Ε͏́΋ΧήΠή΁ϸ͟Έ Ώ͏́ήΧ͋ Φ͏ϋ΋ή͋ ή͙ ν͏ρΎρϋ̳Χ́͏ Ύρ Χήϋ ϦρΎΧ΁ ϋ͏́΋ΧήΠή΁ϸ   is the prescribed manner. 8 ͭΠΎΧ͏Ά ΋Ή & ΈΎΧ́΋Ά ΕΉ ΏΙρ͏νρ ̳ρ !΁͏Χϋρ ή͙ Ε͏́΋ΧήΠή΁Ύ̳́Π C΋̳Χ΁͏͟Έ Ιρ͏νρ ̳́Χ ΎΧ͙ΠϦ͏Χ́͏ ϋ͏́΋ΧήΠή΁ϸΆ ΎΧρϋ͏̳͋ ή͙   technology influencing the users.   4 “Sure you can!” Alex waves her arms dramatically. She pulls a tablet out of her bag. “Look, the application is right here online.

I take it and roll lazily onto my back, like she did earlier. It feels wonderful. I look at the application. I’m torn.     *****************  When I get home, mom’s on the phone with my brother.

1) Elicit the personal names of all the kin known to him or her (whether they’ve met or not), along with how these people are related to your informant.  If the informant is married, collect the names of his/her spouse's kin, so far as they are known.  We will go over methods for collecting this information in class.  
2) Collect certain kinds of standardized information about each relative named by your informant.  You can do this as you obtain each name, or after obtaining all the names, or you can save these questions for a second interview.  If you set up a second interview, you can review your notes from the first to discover and correct omissions and errors.   Collect the following for each name, to the extent possible:                 a.  Age and whether alive today     b.  Gender     c.  Occupation      d.  Marital status (including widowed or divorced or cohabitating)     e.     f.  Residence location      g.  When (approximately) informant last saw him/her, and on what occasion      h.  By what kin term the informant refers to him/her and addresses him/her - these Spouse's name, if applicable  may be different, viz. English father vs. daddy  
3) Collect all additional kin terms in the informant's language, even though the informant may not have or know the name of a kinsperson related in that manner (e.g., in English, second-cousins or first-cousins-once-removed) [don’t forget to do this!].    Write-up  Present the complement of kin terms in a kinship terminology chart, or in a list, with descriptions of what each term covers using the following notation:           Fa Father Da Daughter Br Brother Wi Wife  2    Mo Mother So Son  Si Sister Hu Husband   Do not use ambiguous English terms, such as uncle or cousin, or translate words like “in-law” (e.g., “brother-in-law” can mean wi br, hu br, si hu br, or br wi br).  Since this is not a course in phonology, you should not worry about difficulties in transcribing the sounds of the language your informant speaks.  You may devise your own notation using letters and/or other symbols to approximate what you are hearing.  If your informant is upset by this or tries to tell you how to write the language, take field notes on this interesting interaction and continue to transcribe in a notation that best helps you record the sounds you’re hearing.  The goal is consistency.  It is useful, if you have time, to talk about relatives and kinship in general.  On what occasions and for what purposes do kinspersons get together?  Who are the kinspersons your informant feels closest to, the most obligations toward, the friendliest with, etc., etc.?    To complete the assignment, hand in:  
4.  
5.  
6. A clean, clear copy of the interviewee’s genealogy.  You may include a genealogical diagram of the informant's relatives, or just a list – it's up to you. A skeleton diagram of the kinship system, i.e., map the kinship relations between all kin terms in the informant's language (so far as they are known).   A discussion of which kin relations seem to you, on the basis of this case study, to be of most and least significance in the culture of your informant.  Explain your reasoning. A discussion of the problems you encountered while taking the genealogy, transcribing the sounds, figuring out how to diagram the kin terms, etc.  Also discuss possible uses for the information you have recorded and what other information you didn't collect that might have been useful. How might you go about this task differently were you to do it again?   The Introduction and Discussion sections of your report must total at least 3 double-spaced typewritten pages.   3 MIT OpenCourseWarehttp://ocw.mit.edu21A.801J / EC.702J / STS.071J / EC.792J / 21A.839J / STS.481J Cross-CulturalInvestigations: Technology and DevelopmentFall 2012For information about citing these materials or our Terms of Use, visit: http://ocw.mit.edu/terms.
1. A large, complex event that occurs only occasionally — e.g., a political rally or street festival. Or a special-occasion ritual event that takes place regularly such as a religious celebration, a wedding, a graduation, etc. Behavior typical of certain situations — e.g., mornings in a convenience store, performing jury duty, riding public transportation, shopping in a grocery store, visiting a museum, touring typical tourist destinations, attending a theater performance, etc.  This assignment is weighted more to your analysis, your “read” of the situation. Show me that you’re acquiring the skills of “seeing” as an ethnographer! To be sure you gather enough data to generate significant opportunity for analysis, here are some things to keep in mind while taking field notes:  
2.  
3.   
4.  
5.  Look for the structure of the situation: are the participants differentiated from each other, as, e.g., leaders and followers, or those with more or less status? Is status differentiation or equality represented in dress, behavior, symbolic markers, differing prerogatives? How do people interact with each other? Are there any elements of ritual, either formal or informal, in what you observe? How do you interpret the meaning and effect of these ritualized behaviors? What appear to be the unspoken – or spoken -- rules that underlie this event or activity? Is there any mechanism for correcting a distortion or a mistake? Is there any formal authority? To what extent is it respected? Do people seem to follow the rules, explicit or tacit, or do they bend them? Is the event characterized more by order and agreement or conflict and disorder? Do all participants seem to be deriving the same benefits or satisfactions from participation? Do they have means of communicating positive or negative judgments about the situation?  2    
6.  
7. Are there stylized actions or modes of self-presentation that seem characteristic of this event?  Do the participants seem aware of them? What purpose do they serve? What shared values or assumptions are reinforced (or contested) through this event?  
8.  PLEASE pick an interesting subject — something you’re genuinely curious about — but also one that is not so familiar to you. I strongly recommend that you venture off the MIT campus. If you do remain on campus, observe something unfamiliar to yourself.  Turn in:  your raw field notes as well as your post-hoc typed elaboration of your handwritten notes your summary, descriptive write-up of the observation (scene-setting and highlights) your analysis and interpretation of the scene (using the above questions as a guide) your self-critique — be sure to touch on both epistemological and ethical issues of research  e.g., to what extent did you ‘participate’ and to what extent did you ‘observe’? How did the two inform each other? Comment on the effect (hopefully minimal) of your presence and the degree to which you understood the activity without having directly questioned the participants.

1) Overview of problem and setting:    what is the problem, from a public health perspective? what is the local concern (if one is recognized), from a cultural and structural  perspective?  how might these be reconciled or brought into dialogue? if no local concern (from  their perspective) is identifiable, how does this affect your planning and approach? how might cultural beliefs and local infrastructure/expertise be approached as a resource?  note: This section will be based on library research that you conduct. I suggest Anthrosource and Anthropology Plus (http://libraries.mit.edu/get/anthro-plus) as a useful databases through Vera. Be sure to cite appropriately. I would like all of you to do some outside reading on your site/problem, although one of you can take responsibility for writing the overview.   
2) Proposal for addressing problem through an educational campaign to encourage particular behaviors and/or the uses of new and/or existing technologies.  who will your campaign target (individuals and/or groups; women and/or men; etc. etc.)? how? where — through what venues?  1include prototypes of any educational materials (e.g., posters, leaflets, public presentations/demonstrations) that your campaign will use [see ORT article]  keep in mind that your campaign can be multi-pronged; i.e., you can address different constituencies using different messages, tactics  note: this section should be discussed collaboratively, although one of you can take charge of the design of the materials  
3) Methodology for field-testing the protocol. How do you propose to field-test your protocol? What questions remain unanswered from the literature? What would you need to learn in the field to refine your program? How would you go about acquiring that information — through interviews (with whom? asking what?)? through participant-observation (where? of what?)? from gathering data presumably kept by local institutions? This is basically your methods section, and you should refer to (use the lingo of) and cite the methods readings from the syllabus.  note: again, you should discuss this together, and then one of you take responsibility for writing up the methods section.  
4) Ethics and Rationale. Here you discuss how and why you came to plan that you propose. What alternatives did you consider, and why did you shoot them down? What are the limits to your proposal? What of the problem sketched initially are you unable to address here? What further work is suggested? What ethical concerns have you considered and do you anticipate? How will you mitigate these in practice? Here you should draw heavily on our syllabus and class discussions. Quote and cite our authors. Show me what you’ve learned in this class and that you’re able to apply lessons from one case study in thinking through another.  note: again, you should discuss this together, and then one of you take responsibility for writing up the methods section.  
5) Bibliography. Comprehensive from the entire proposal, including readings on the syllabus.  Let me be clear: I expect you collectively to discuss the issues and arguments that will go into each of the first four sections of the proposal, but you will each take responsibility for writing one of the sections. I also expect you to draft your portion early enough to solicit critical feedback from your colleagues. That is, you should each review the other sections of the proposal and give comments in sufficient time that the author can incorporate the constructive criticism prior to final submission. I suggest Saturday before the final class as a deadline to exchange AND READ sections among one other.  I will grade each of the sections as well as the proposal overall. Your grade for the final project will be an average of the two. 2MIT OpenCourseWarehttp://ocw.mit.edu21A.801J / EC.702J / STS.071J / EC.792J / 21A.839J / STS.481J Cross-CulturalInvestigations: Technology and DevelopmentFall 2012For information about citing these materials or our Terms of Use, visit: http://ocw.mit.edu/terms.
1. The role of human masses and masses of machines – who is serving who Bowker quotes from The Official Soviet Short Philosophical Dictionary (
2. So, What is “Human”? “Copernicus challenged our human self-image by showing that the Earth was not the center of the universe; Darwin by showing that humans were not God's special creation; and Freud by showing that we are not rational animals, but that much of our thoughts and behavior is rooted in biological drives and unconscious proc esses. The present volume contributes a fourth reshaping of the human self-image, as we see that much that is human can, at least potentially, be shared by machines.”(Arbib, 
3. On imperialism, natural choice/evolution and politics of power  Bowker writes that cyberniticians employed “imperialist rhetoric”. This is not all that surprising. If we adopt a sociological lens, we can understand the struggle of cyberniticians for self-definition as yet another mere struggle for position of influence and power – no different than that of other groups of people sharing a vision, a profession or an academic discipline (cf.

Throughout virtually all of human history, social organization coincided with spatial organization.” (Webber, 1968, Daedalus, Journal of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences)  (
2) “In sum, the spatial forces set in motion by teleservice are complex, and sometimes tug in different directions at once. They can produce both decentralizing and recentralizing tendencies. They can break the bond between local demand and local supply of services, but they can also reinforce the dominance of established service centers.” (Mitchell, 1999, p.
3.  Discs (great...)  Student C  Here's some visuals/texts related to my thesis that involve virtual identities/cyberspace:   Malamud during the opening speech as Sec-General of the 1996 Internet Expo:   Marshall McLuhan, the philospher who became a famous media guru in the 1960s, had a saying: "the medium is the message." He meant that any medium–TV, radio, newspapers–changes the nature of the content it provides. …But "the medium is the message" means something else on the Internet. … We have another saying for this Internet World's Fair: "Finally, the medium isn't the message!" Our goal is to reach out to all walks of life, to see the amount of content on the Internet grow and change. The Internet is a fundamental infrastructure, a part of our daily lives. This technology is beginning to reach all of society and it is important that we take the time to make sure that the technology is relevant to all people, to all walks of life. The Internet shouldn't be a discussion group about computers, it should be a place where artists and world leaders and chefs and small businessmen are able to all participate in a technology as fundamental as radio, or electricity, or mass transit.   Courtesy of Carl Malamud. Used with permission.  Student E  The two reading is a great personal observation and for me it’s almost like reading a novel. This else-world is a great way to explore human imagination and it’s amazed me to know how wild and unique that imaginations could be.   Yet, I’m simply not capable of considering second life as another kind of dream. I’m not sure that this world is so much different than the real life we actually have. As Boellstorff try not to question the moral issue in the second life [p.5], it is that issue that I think made the second life and real life is pretty much the same. The idea that people tried or pretend to become someone else that they don’t is so happen everyday in the real world. It’s just a matter of visualizing that avatar.   Second-life might be very different if people tried to simulate what could we have in the real life, but with just a little gap between the present and the future, between the possibility and constructability.    As an architect, I have my own second-life or to be precise, my wannabe-life. That is when I tried to model my design and simulating how it can happen in the reality. I treat my wannabe-life as a transit terminal of my ideas. Some already take-off and landed in the real-life, some unlucky ones still sitting and wandering in the terminal. Yet, I think the sensation of playing with this delayed passengers is pretty much the same with playing those the avatar in the second-life or in the gaming world.

1) I agree about the lack of breadth in the descriptions of how mobile devices are used in different local settings. The work of Jan Chipchase provides some richness to this conversation. He focuses on the specific local practices that have arisen around the use of mobile technologies in a non-Western setting: Shared Phone Use (
2) What I like about the Ito et al. paper is the focus on spatial ramifications in the immediate surroundings of a person through the use of their mobile devices. I really appreciate their categories because they demonstrate how non-deterministic the use of mobile technologies in public spaces really is.   To this point, Wanda pointed out an interesting snippet about mobile phone use in China. Though this article also highlights the communication-use of the mobile devices there are specific ramifications for the social setting and the relationship to the physical location of the people as they pick up their calls in the middle of a public talk or meeting.  Student E   I thought the readings were quite interesting this week -- I was particularly interested in Green’s use of Doren Massey’s use of “power-geometries” that are revealed by questions about who moves and who doesn’t as we consider mobility. I found myself considering the (somewhat) parallel tensions implicit between individualized and customized technologies and infrastructures – I have just started reading some of Nicholas Rose’s work on the relationship between economic life and individuals, and how the drive toward self-regulation has freed the state to do less of the day-to-day governing and more of the “steering.” We are pushed to become mobile as much as mobility is something we seek out ---   Finally, I found Ito et al’s hybrid methodology of ethnographic work combined with self-reflexive diary-keeping fascinating because it results in results that offered traditional qualitative insights but also explicitly relied upon the subjects themselves to engage in the process of producing research on their own practices. Given Student B’s sense that these outcomes were pretty self-evident, I wonder whether in fact the researchers should have pushed the subjects to have more rigorously engaged in self-reflexive practices (which the final interview and diary review presumably were intended to do). Anthropologist Geraldine Bloustein, who used amateur video-making to study identity experimentation in public and private among adolescent girls, also explored collaborative data collection. I would like to see a study that focused more explicitly on this question rather than a comparative analysis that I sensed collapsed some important nuances in the interest of fitting practices into labels like “cocooning” and “camping”. That said, I still found this article provocative.
1. Beautifully packaged and storytold deliverables... frozen  Whenever we can, we pushed for a PDF deliverable as opposed to PowerPoint deliverables. A format that is frozen and will not be modified by the client later. Reasons being 
2) we want to keep the integrity and quality of our work, so frozen format like PDF or movies prevents the work from being bastardized by someone in the client organization later. Of course, we'd oblige if the client needed a PowerPoint version, but generally PDF was much more preferred.  IDEO preferred presenting the deliverables at the IDEO office, in a set up room, with a good storyteller present. Rather than delivering a dry artifact, IDEO tried to deliver the mood/sensitivity around a concept and sense of change. Therefore, narrated movies were used more and more often. It was more important to get the client personnel present in that room to buy into the idea and attitude, rather than the details.   
3. No "knowledge management" system   When I led groups of visitors to tour IDEO studios, one of the frequent questions was about "knowledge management" -- how does IDEO retain its knowledge and skills?   There were two canned answers for that question. First is to point at the "Tech Box" -- each IDEO office keeps a drawer tower of interesting materials and mechanisms that are collected by everyone, tagged and databased. Second answer was that we don't employ a system, but we believe in the knowledge embodied in the people, as IDEO hired an eclectic mix of people. And that it was permitted for everyone to spam everyone else with random questions, like "how do I find a butterfly observatory?" "do you brush teeth in the shower? why?" "anyone know about the therapeutic aspects of lights?" etc.   I think above attitudes I described above is in line with the general trend about intellectual property in the industry:  Ideas are free, but the service is not. Rather than valuing the details of the designs or visuals we created, we want you to like how we can catalyze changes and improvements to your portfolio. Let's do a $60K workshop before we sign on to do a $400K LCD monitor design work. If you like what you see at the workshop, we know you will come back for three more $400K projects. Similarly at the Media Lab, we surrender the IP in exchange for the rights to continue working on cool things and maintain a brand.  The sum (organization) is bigger than its parts (individuals). People at the Media Lab or IDEO aren't particularly geniuses. It's the place that creates the magic, the cross pollination, professional courtesy and mutual respect. This is also why the client/sponsor organizations will never be able to replicate us in-house. They will have to keep paying to have us around.  Student EIntellectual Property and Standards are two of my enemies! I didn't write a response on time for class yesterday, but I'm going to add some of my ideas and thoughts on the readings here anyway.  It's not that I think that we can develop and design new technology without the abstractions that standards afford. The standards are necessary for interoperability but also to be able to develop larger technologies that use the parts the standards define as modules. The problem that I have with a lot of standards is that they come about in exactly the way described by Newman-- thought up by a lot of the parties who have interests beyond creating the lightest, most elegant standard. Sometimes standards can be made by parties that do not have the financial interests that a lot of software and hardware companies (and now increasingly also wetware companies) and that allows a different perspective on the problem you need to solve. However, nowadays what I'm mostly seeing is large companies making their own standards which include their patented hardware and trying to drown out the competition (like Blu-ray vs HD DVD). To be able to satisfy a standard, you need to have your product certified, a process that for hardware often costs tens of thousands of dollars. Without certifying your wireless object with 
1) a deterministic impact of lighting (i.e. light=safe while dark=dangerous) on space; and (
2) the possibility of an even lighting of spaces over great distances. Interestingly, debates around sustainability and energy consumption have led to sometimes incompatible requirements. People require higher light levels while city governments try to reduce the wattage and frequency of lights.3 In part, uneven lighting conditions at nighttime can be attributed to retail and display lighting as mentioned above. Only as shop owners started to draw customers from the street in addition to their wealthy regulars did retail lighting really gain in importance: What we think of as night life includes this nocturnal round of business, pleasure and illumination. It derives its own, special atmosphere from the light that falls onto the pavements and streets from shops (especially those selling luxury goods), cafés and restaurants, light that is intended to attract passers-by and potential customers. It is advertising light – commercialized festive illumination – in contrast to street light, the lighting of policed order.  2For example, the EPOK programmable display:  http://www.archive.org/details/Behindth1935 3 The City of Cambridge acquired all the street lights in the city a few years ago from the utility companies. As a result, planners are running a comprehensive study of lighting in the city to establish new guidelines for luminaires and more conceptual urban planning and design guidelines. Energy efficiency and sustainability is the primary concern as well as cost savings. Because the city pays a lump sum to the utilities for electricity it is in their interest to make large changes like changing lights rather than incremental improvements which could be gained from more finely tuned programming.

1. Focus – your essay should be developed around a clear central thesis or argument, integrating your own views with material from the articles. 
2. Structure – your essay should be clearly organized in a way that elaborates on and supports your central thesis.  Individual  paragraphs  should  be  cohesive,  and  your  reader  should  be  able  to  follow  the  logical progression of your ideas from one paragraph to the next. 
3.  Evidence/Analysis  –  make  sure  you  support  your  claims  with  well-chosen  examples  from  your  own experience and from the articles - and that you explain how these examples support your points. 
4.  Style  --  your  word  choices  and  sentence  structures  should  enhance  the  clarity  and  argumentative effectiveness of your essay. Essays using ordinary, unpretentious language will receive a higher grade than verbose essays. Your  writing should also adhere to the standard contemporary conventions for grammar, spelling, and usage. Journals  This  class  is  designed  to  challenge  your  views,  ideas,  and  assumptions  on  a  variety  of  issues  including: race, class, justice, history, infrastructure, physical planning, among many others.  As you work through this material, it is important that you keep a journal, which will be given to you, of your thoughts, apprehensions, feelings  and  frustrations  about  the  class  and  the  material.    You  will  find  that  these  first  thoughts  and impressions will help you as you work on later assignments that ask you to take and defend a position about some issue or problem in New Orleans.  You may also find that what you write in this journal may provide you with a better sense of what you want to study while you are here at MIT.    As mentioned in class, the writing you do in this journal is not for us, your instructors, but rather a record for you.  We will be checking that you are doing this writing (by looking at the dates) but we will not be reading your writing.  To this end, you are required to write 1 to 2 pages of random writing five days each week.  Random writing can be anything – poetry, phrases, meandering sentences, sketches, etc, but mostly we are hoping you will use your journal to reflect on what you read, see and hear in and for class.

1.  Describe the moment or event when you first knew you wanted to study architecture.     
2.  Regarding your studies in architecture, which one ability/insight would you most like to gain this term?  Why do you feel it to be important? 
3.  What is the greatest creative/intellectual challenge you will need to overcome to feel you have been successful in studio this term?  (By this I mean your challenge, not one imposed by the curriculum, pressures of other courses, annoying roommates, etc…)  OK – let’s face it - the purpose of this one-page paper is to help me understand what it is that interests you about architecture, what you want to get out of this studio, and what you’re concerned about that may prevent you from succeeding.  It’s also to help me work with you to make sure you do succeed.  So try to be honest with yourself -these assignments will not be read in class, but will remain as a touchstone between you and I over the course of the semester.  I expect that some of your goals may shift, but I want you to force yourselves to at least enter into the discussion with yourself and with me.  Like most creative fields, architecture requires passion, so I expect your answers to contain a little of that – if you saw the Empire State Building shrouded in mist from a train in New Jersey when you were seven years old and just knew you had to build buildings, great.  If you had an uncle who drew cool houses and lived in a really funky one, and you always admired him, great.  If you just woke up one day and said “Oh no, I gotta declare a major”, and then picked architecture because it was “kinda cool” – then tell me why it’s kinda cool.     Try to keep you answers succinct – please give me a one-page printout at 2:00pm on Monday.   If you have any questions prior to that time, please ask.   
1.  The space you conceptualize in this design problem is relatively small, it should not exceed 6’ x 8’ x 8’ (width/length/height). 
2.  It is a study of an idealized “pod”, as it were, in which to work while not at home or office. 
3.  It should confront the issues you raised in your own critique of positive and negative attributes of place in Assignment 2 
4.  Think of what you design as a free-standing element.  Any access or control of light/sound/view/privacy, etc. must be defined by elements you place.  i.e. it does not depend on an existing place for its quality.

1.  Using your current iterative process, you will continue to develop your designs at the scale you are working (1”=20” or 1”=16”). You will (with your TAs) select the best, most appropriate design from the options you have created, and you will moving forward in that direction by producing a series of iterative models.  For the Pin-up April 4th, you will have a new scaled massing model in situ on your site model explaining your single direction. 
2.  You will select a SPECIFIC for your design.  It is un-acceptable to simply say you are creating flexible space for all artists to live and work in.  As Koolhaas states in the excerpt above, you are asked to “rigorously research your client’s needs”.  To this end, you are asked to select an artistic endeavor that appeals to you.  It could be sculpture, performance, video, built installation, painting, etc. Choose a living contemporary artist (and their work), as an exemplar of the type of work that you would like to facilitate, and design in such a way that their needs are met without making your space so specific that other artists could not also use it.  Create a one page sheet outlining the type of work and its specific needs.  This could include photographs of a practitioner’s studio, a

These portions of your assignment will be representative of your design direction at a larger, more defined scale.  These will not be suggestions, but will be required elements of a complete submission. 
4.  You will have revised conceptual statements from Assignment 9, and be prepared to relate those statements to your reviewers as soon as you begin presenting on April 4th.  These should be 2 or 3 sentences that encapsulate your BIG idea, and justify and help clarify all other design decisions you have subsequently made. photograph of one of their installations, showings, or performances, and a short list of their spatial requirements.  You are free to approximate this, but are encouraged to research it directly.  The more specifically you understand the requirements, the more precise be your design decisions.  This must be completed by Monday, March 28th, so that your choice can inform your work in studio the week prior to the Pin-Up for this assignment (the week after Spring Break).   You are asked to submit your scans and photographs for Assignment 10 by Wednesday, April 6th.        
1.  Select your site.  Draw it in section showing grades and context.  Define and outline the shapes of the principle spaces (not forms) of your design.  Place the objects and fixtures in your design.  Consider how these fixtures might alter your previous notions about the shape of the space.  If they do, re-configure the space to accommodate the fixtures and the uses they are intended for.  Similarly, consider how light enters the space, or how the issue of privacy is dealt with.  Through an iterative process, continually re-define the shape of the space so that it satisfies the above noted parameters as well as those implicit in your “design concept.”   
2.  Once the cross sectional space reflects your design intentions, begin to more definitively bound      the form of your space with building materials and systems.  You may select three of the following systems from which to build your space / structure:      Wood ( stick lumber, plywood etc) Masonry (brick, concrete, tiles)  Concrete (poured in place, pre-cast) Glass (structural, sandblasted, clear, colored etc) Metal - in plate or mesh form- (copper, steel, aluminum, zinc etc.) 
3.  On a separate layer, speculate on the constructed quality of the your choice of materials and systems.  Once you have defined your construction, create a composite drawing which both illustrates the quality of space and the role that the building vocabulary has in creating your space. 
4.  Render the play of light on your material and construction palette. Be sure to delineate the exterior as well.    For the Ambitious: Show a partial elevation of the exterior skin next to the section drawing.  You may also wish to show a partial plan of the sectional drawing under the section.

1) Creating site documentation  Before embarking on design explorations, it is important to generate a strong base of information about the site, its topography, natural features and patterns of development. Using historical maps, aerial images, and information derived from photographs, this group will do its best to create a good base map approximating the physical reality of Quantanomo Bay as it stands today.  
2) History First discovered by Columbus in 1494, the bay has a rich history. The naval base resulted from a treaty in 1903, and to this day allows the US to occupy a valuable and strategic asset in Cuba. This group should describe in depth the historic development of the Bay, and its impact on larger geo-political issues. Maps identifying key stages of development should be included as should images and supporting text.  
3) Natural Systems The Bay has a unique ecological condition, due to its location and climate.  This group will identify and document all the factors that contribute to its ecology. This will include, climate, geology, hydrology, topography, fauna, wildlife etc.  
4) Program Generally, what are all the program elements necessary to support a naval base of this size, and more specifically, what are the facilities required for the detention centers. What is required to sustain the life and health of the prisoners and staff alike? Where do their worlds overlap and how?  Are the needs of the prisoners being met, and if not how are the facilities / services deficient?  
5) Precedents Prisoner of war camps are not new, and many models from history can be documented and analyzed to better understand the evolution of interment centers.  Create a catalog of historic prisoner of war – like facilities and describe their operations, history and impact on prisoner life.  Similarly, analyze contemporary prison facilities, not only in the US, but also across cultures.  What is the role of architecture meeting security needs while providing humane standards of internment. Of special interest are precedents that are located in similar climates.  
6) Building materials and systems Located on a base, where everything has to be shipped or flown in, how are buildings and structures built? What materials and systems are used? What systems might be more appropriate given the climate?  
7) Legal / Political Issues What are the rights of an “unlawful combatant,” who determines them and by what international measure are they to be judged?  What are the legitimate rights of a country to protect it, while still recognizing and protecting human rights?  Who are the detainees? Where do they come from? What crimes have they committed and how will their cases be processed? What has this done to our international rights, and what does it portend for future engagements, where US citizens might be taken captive under a similar status? Document and illustrate these issues as much as you can with examples / articles and legal arguments.  
8) Visual Library and Bibliography Small thumbnail images will be cataloged and organized around themes describing the physical quality of this place and life on the base.  Include maps, photos etc. Enlarge only those that are of special value, and reference sources in each case.  Also generate a bibliography of reference material, and categorized by subject matter (legal, naval, architectural etc.)   Each group will produce a “package” (
1) Determine which issues or problems you wish to address.  Based on the preliminary research that we have conducted as a group over the past week, you are to consider what are the important issues that you believe need to be addressed.  There are no limits to the types of problems and issues you may wish to address.  Ideally, they have some significance as regards the life of the people that inhabit the island, as well as commenting on larger geo-political, and ethical issues. In other words, try to avoid trivial issues.   For instance, you may determine that there is a greater need for social / relaxation spaces for the guards to help relieve the guards from the stress of guarding detainees. This determination would result from your analysis of the program elements that you determined were on the site, and research documenting that guards assigned to this type of assignment are especially susceptible to stress disorders for instance.  Deliverable: Provide a statement (and diagrams) describing how you decided on the topic of your investigation.  
2) Generate Concept / Identify the content of the program  Based on your analysis of a problem(s) or issue(s) associated with the Quantanomo Bay, you are to develop a program. Which types of program elements you decide on including in your program should be driven by a larger concept, or set of intentions.    For instance, in the previous example, you may have decided that swimming, bathing, etc. would be an ideal source of relaxation, and therefore you were going to develop an aquatic recreational center, complete with pools, saunas, steam baths and massage therapies.  Your concept would be driven by a deeper understanding of water’s recuperative powers, research into its benefits, and the types of facilities that are best suited for supporting your objectives.   This is a great opportunity for invention, and you are encouraged to think of clever ways in which you can package conventional program elements to create new and exciting environments.  Deliverable: State your concept and intentions and the types of programs that support your objectives.  Back them up with research on the program types and their relationship to your concept.  Use images, illustrations and diagrams to supplement your proposals. It is also useful to provide examples of precedents that may apply to your particular proposal.  
3) Site Selection: Based on your analysis of problems and issues associated with the base, select an appropriate site. In some cases your site selection may be obvious, or even the source of the problem / issue that you have identified. In other cases, you will have to consider what kinds of criteria will need to be established to determine the viability and appropriateness of the site.  This suggests that after you have selected potential sites that you will have conduct a “mini” site analysis for each site.   For instance, is the site build able, is the access to the site convenient, are the natural conditions (sun, wind, water etc) supportive of your program?  Deliverables: Using the base maps, circle the potential sites. Analyze each site based on the factors that you think are most important. Present an assessment of the results of your analysis. This can be done through drawings, maps, diagrams, charts etc.  
4) Conceptual / Schematic Design Develop some initial design proposals based on your ideas. These explorations can be very “sketchy” and loose. You can use modeling, graphics, computer collages, or material studies.    Deliverables: Models, collages, sketches etc.  
5) Establishing Process / Schedule Based on completing the above noted steps, assess the most appropriate process for developing the design of your project. Develop a schedule for the rest of the semester, which takes this into consideration. What are the target dates you are setting for your self for each weekly pin-up? Once you set up this schedule, your reviewers will hold you to it each week.  Deliverable: A statement / description of your proposed process and an accompanying schedule.  Format:   With the exception of item #4, you are encouraged to format all of your work on 11 x 17 sheets or multiples thereof.     
1. Begin the assignment by taking ten length measurements of various parts of your body. This set of measurements should have some type of conceptual alignment such as a set of circumferences or series of length measurements of different appendages. Record each dimension. 
2. Along with each measurement, you should record the correspond­ing range of motion of each part measured, expressed in degrees. Example: 
3. Shoulder to Shoulder Length -- 28“ - Range of Motion -- 0° - 65° Step Two: 
1. Wall Mounted Vellum 
2. Drawing Board Vellum 
3. Light Source 
4. Dowel 
5. Wire Form 11” x 17” Vellum Taped to Wall.1 ASSIGNMENT 
6. In three stages, move the form away from the wall along the choreographed path. 
7. At each stage, trace the shadow that is produced on the vellum and notate the movements and rotations of the forms on the vellum below. Step Two: 
1. Begin by attaching two sheets of 11” x 11” vellum  to your drawing board and a nearby wall, perpendicular to each other as shown. 
2. Locate a desk lamp or other directional light source as a specific point relative to the vellum. DO NOT MOVE THE LIGHT SOURCE AFTER THIS STEP. 
3. Place the wire form up against the vellum attached to the wall - until it touches. 
4. Using a pencil lightly trace the shadows produced. Do not abstract or reduce the shadows. Draw them exactly as they appear. 
5. Translate the rule you developed for bending the wire into a ‘choreography’ of movements, shifts and rotations. 
6. In three stages, move the form away from the wall along the choreographed path. 
7. At each stage, trace the shadow that is produced on the vellum and notate the movements and rotations of the forms on the vellum below. Step Two: 
1) A. 82” -----1/40-----> 
2) A. 74” -----1/40-----> 
3) A. 53” -----1/40-----> 
4. Round each dimension to the nearest 1/2“ increment. Step Two: Draw three 3” x 3” squares, with subdivisions on each edge for every 1“ to create nine smaller squares. These should be drawn with the lightest pen weight with a 1/8” dashed line. Step Three: Continue to subdivide each square in 1/2” increments in the X and Y direction. This series of lines should be drawn as a solid line with the same pen used in Step Two. Step Four: Using the dimensions from the first space, create a composition of lines with each line segment falling on the grid lines of your square drawings. Each of the three drawings should have a different composition; do not repeat any drawing. You can use the length as a distance. Repeat: Repeat this process two more times, measuring your body while performing different actions in different spaces. The result should be a list of three spaces with a total of 27 dimensions, represented as nine square drawing compositions. Once you have completed all of the drawings, move on to Assignment

2. Joinery Techniques ASSIGNMENT 
1. How  does your  system scale-up  or  scale-down  to  its extremes?  Can  you  “grow”  more of  your  project outs 
2. How  does your  precedent and  its logic translate to  human,  architectural or  material phenomena?    
3. Develop  a social and  programmatic provocation  that  situations  your  architectural structure in  a specific location,  at a specific scale and  defines how  people use it.   Bringing in  more  specific notions of function and scale, study the possibilities your project offers to accommodate human  occupation of these spaces.

1) the lack of affordable housing and protection for those people falling out of the security of our economic system, and 
2) the overabundance of waste flowing from an economic system of disposable consumption. This studio exercise looks to use the second to assist the first. Students in groups of 5 or 6 will Design and Build creative solutions for the temporary sheltering of those without homes, using standard materials from the piles of waste typically discarded daily from MIT and other readily accessible local sources, as well as inexpensive new materials of general availability. The success of the design shall be based on the following criteria, 
3)  Structure: An ability to withstand the force of storm winds without collapse. 
4)  Thermal and Moisture Protection: An ability to keep the inhabitant comfortable and dry in a broad range of weather, temperature and internal humidity conditions, through waterproofing, insulation, heating, and natural ventilation.  
5)  Transport: An ability to easily dismantle, move and reconstruct the shelter without the inhabitant having to rely on the use of any outside vehicle or physical assistance, other then a shopping cart and their own simple construction skill.

1) political changes in previously closed countries, inviting large populations to enter the global economic market, 
2) the rapid growth and spread of computer technology, allowing for ease of global communication, open access to information, and mastery of complex processes by compact organizations and/or individuals, and 
3) the reorganization of the work force to take advantage of the opportunities and challenges these changes produce. Our social, economic and built world is likely to be dramatically effected. While a dialogue between regional forces and cosmopolitan ideas has traditionally shaped the environment, the slow pace of change has kept this interrelationship relatively balanced. Today, however, the speed in which ideas travel around the world and influence our daily lives is unprecedented. How are these changes to be managed by countries, institutions, business and individuals? With this in mind, the design projects we will pursue for the remainder of the studio will involve an environment for scholars (academics, artists, scientists, business leaders, etc…) from around the world to come together for a defined period of time to live amongst fellows, study the benefits and concerns of Globalization and share ideas with one another and the world beyond.

1.  Living area 
2.  Work area 
3.  Cooking and Eating area 
4.  Sleeping areas (could be several) 
5.  Bathroom The total area for this should not exceed 1000 square feet, this is close to 5 times the amount of space most people in the world live in. First part of the project is clue searching, attitude statement, program first sketches and sketch model. This will be followed by the final assignment including final model, drawings, model of site and presentation. 
1.  One 20 x 30 board to include your attitude about the building,  program uses and sizes (make areas of colored paper to show sizes) and sketches about how you might Assignment 6  -  “Making a Community Place” Clues, Attitude, Program and Design Ideas  For this first assignment you are asked to think about what this building wants to be. What is the program that would satisfy your needs and bring people together in the community?. What kind of spaces for work would you need? How can we design buildings in our present society that can address the issue of community?  How can we design a building that will be a “coming together” celebration and can help achieve peace. What is the connection to nature?  How can nature be introduced into the city? The basic program for the site should be between 6000 and 8000 square feet in building that has in places, at least three floors. No matter what you program might be the following types  and sizes of spaces should be included. 
2. Having an attitude, program and sketch ideas about the project the next step is to start the design process.  We will start by working in model form and then later work with drawings. However, sketches of your ideas in plan, section and perspective in your sketch book should always be part of the process.  The first is very abstract and at 1/16” scale build a quick context model of the area and with found objects make a quick design of your initial ideas about the general form of the building and ideas about the integration of nature. Use what objects you can find and think of the idea of the design but let the objects inform you of the design. Please do not try to impose your initial thoughts about the design.

2.  A farm situated in the open countryside induces the wind flow’s speed, equal to 120 km/h over  the  land,  to  be  increased  by  40%  when  passing  over  its  roof,  whose  surface  is       400 m
3.  The  Kimbell  Art  Museum,  located  in  Fortworth  (Texas)  and  designed  by  Louis  Kahn  in 1972, appears as a sequence of linear adjacent modules, each supporting a thin roof shell presenting  a  slit  along  in  their  main  dimension  to  allow  natural  daylight  to  illuminate  the exposition halls.  1/4                               On a warm and humid day in August, the outside temperature was found equal to 90°F. What heat transfer [W] allows the recommended inside temperature to be reached (see ASHRAE table below)?  This  value  is  to  be  calculated  for  both  an  individual  shell  (assumed  of  hemi-cylindrical  shape) and for the entire roof. Heat is assumed to transfer through the roof only (heat losses/gains through the lateral walls are neglected).  2/4  Calculate  the  U-value  of  the  roof  shells  using  the  geometric  and  conductivity  data  provided below.    Total surface : ~ 5500 m2a. Waterproof lead foil b. Two layers of plywood c.  Rigid thermal insulation d. Reinforced concrete shell  
4.  The Phillips Exeter Academy Library, located in Exeter (New Hampshire) and designed by Louis  Kahn  in  1967-1970,  is  organized  around  an  impressive  central  atrium  of  square section that is more than 20 m high.       During a cold winter day, the inside and outside temperatures have been measured and found to be 68°F and 14°F respectively. Because  the  main  building  doors  are  constantly  being  opened  and  closed,  the  inside  and outside pressures are equal at ground level. Calculate the pressure difference between inside and outside: 3/4 - at level 2 (1 storey up from ground i.e. 3 m from ground)   - at level 8 (7 stories up from ground i.e. 
1.  Two  grams  of  water  vapor  condense  on  a  glass  panel  of  dimensions  50  x  100  cm  and thickness  4  mm.  The  initial  temperature  of  the  glass  is  10°C.  What  is  its  final temperature? The temperature is assumed to be uniform over the whole glass area and the glass does not exchange any heat with its environment (adiabatic transformation).  Latent heat for water condensation = 2477 kJ/kg at 10°C. You will need to use the Data sheet D.
2.  In a 100 m3 room, the air temperature is decreased from an initial value of 30°C to 16°C then increased to 24°C.  If the initial relative humidity was 75%, what is its value at the end? Provide this value for the  two  possible  processes  that  can  take  place  when  increasing  the  temperature  from 16°C to 24°C. Use the psychrometric chart given below to solve this exercise, What mass of water vapor has been condensed into liquid water? 1/3 
3.  On a plain at 200 m altitude, fresh (18°C) and humid (HR=70%) air is flowing from South to North. It passes a 2500 m high mountain range and thereafter flows down to a second plain situated at 400 m altitude. Using the psychrometric chart given below and knowing that the temperature of non-saturated air decreases by 10 °K every 1000 m altitude (dry adiabatic  gradient)  and  by  6  °K  every  1000  m  for  air  saturated  in  water  vapor  (humid adiabatic gradient), answer the following questions:    On  what  side  of  the  mountain  and  at  what  altitude  does  condensation  start  (i.e.  will  be observe the cloud’s base) ?  What are the temperature and relative humidity of the air at the top of the mountain ? What do these values become when the air reaches the second plain ? 11030%9 0100908070250 C)60Enthalpy(kj/kg)Saturation temperature(

1.  The average energy used for heating a 1980’s single family home  is roughly 84 x 106 kJ, 80 x 106 BTU in a climate similar to Boston or Madison, Wisconsin.  Heating is mainly needed for the six coldest months.  Use the enclosed table of daily solar radiation, taken from ASHRAE Handbook of Fundamentals  1997, to estimate, to within 15 to 20 percent accuracy, the size of a solar collector needed, in ft,or m2, to supply 75% of the heating energy for the house for the six winter months.

2. setback; the interior temperature of a building is reduced during the evening.  The heat transferred from the building to the outside air is directly proportional to the temperature difference between the building interior and the outdoor ambient temperature.  Between the hours of 8 AM and 10 PM the interior temperature in the winter should remain at 20C. At night for the remaining 10 hours, it cannot fall below 12 C when the ambient temperature is constant at 0C.  a) You are asked to design a control strategy, when to turn the heater off and on, to stay within these temperature limits while minimizing the total heater energy for a 24 hour period.  For a given building you will be given an Excel program that will be predict the internal temperature response and heater energy. The heater only has three setting, on low, on high and off. Setting the heater on low at steady state will just maintain the house at 12C. You can design the maximum heater size, high, the  maximum heater output as a multiple of the low setting between 1 and

1) Simmons Hall, the newest MIT student dorm on campus should  be operated to minimize energy use.  One proposed strategy to reduce air conditioning energy in the summer is night cooling.  At 8 p.m. the windows are opened and cool night air is circulated through the room.  By 8 a.m. the room air and the concrete floor slab have a temperature close to that of the outside air, 18 degrees Centigrade. The slab is four inches thick. At 8 a.m. the windows are closed and heat transfer to the cooled floor slab helps to maintain a comfortable interior temperature.  Neglect any heat transfer through the closed windows.  Assume that the average rate of electrical and solar energy into the room totals 500 watts over the 12 hours.     a)Sketch the room temperature vs. time for the 12 hour period between 8 a.m. and 8 p.m. What is the maximum room temperature? Assume as a limiting case that the slab and the air temperature are always equal. In reality, do you expect the slab to be at a lower or higher temperature than the air? b) Can you suggest an improved strategy for window opening and closing during the day?   
2) To supplement the night cooling strategy described above, it is proposed to spray liquid water droplets into the air.  If the room air at 8 a.m. is completely dry what is the maximum amount of liquid water that can be evaporated into the room air at 18 degrees Centigrade?  Assume that the room is closed up and there is no air circulation from the outside into the room.  
3) Using both night cooling and the maximum amount of liquid water evaporation in the room, estimate the room temperature at 8 p.m. From 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. the windows are closed and the average electrical and solar energy into the room totals 500 watts.  To solve, write an energy balance for a system including the floor slab, the water and the air.  Take state 1 as liquid water, floor slab and air at 18 degrees Centigrade, the conditions at 8 a.m.  Take state 2 as the slab and saturated air at 8 p.m.

At each location, use the Vernier LabQuest and temperature probe to measure the floor temperature and air temperature at the following heights (1 in, 2 ft, 4 ft, 6 ft, 8 ft above floor). Allow enough time at each height for the temperature reading to reach steady state (ie to settle on a value and not change).  How justified is our assumption about the slab and air temperatures? Is the thermal stratification different at each location? If so, please justify any differences.    MIT OpenCourseWarehttp://ocw.mit.edu 
1.                      A  room  at  steady  state  has  a  supply  air  stream  of  cool  air  entering  at  60oF.    The  lights,  office appliances and people transfer heat to the air so that it leaves at 75oF.  Consider only sensible heat transfer for this problem, with all temperatures given as dry bulb temperatures.  After the air leaves the room some is exhausted from the building.  The remainder mixes with ambient air.  The mixture is  cooled  by  the  chiller  down  to  60oF.    For  ventilation  requirements amb  must  be  at  least  20 percent of the total flow rate.  The total air flow rate to the room and the entering temperature, state 1,  are  held  constant.    The  amount  of  ambient  air  can  be  varied  from  20  percent  up  to  100  %  of total  (with  corresponding  increases  in  the  exhaust  flow  to  keep  the  total  flow  constant).    The State 1 60 oF State 3 total  temperature changes are small so Cp can be considered constant.        a) For an arbitrary ambient temperature develop an expression for chiller in terms of amb and total. b) As the ambient temperature varies between 50oF and 85oF what should be to minimize chiller ? amb and total total  versus  TAMB.    At  different  ambient Show  a  diagram  of  the  optimum temperature levels, e.g., 60, 75 oF, the strategy to minimize the chiller cooling requirement may change.

A water to air heat exchanger is used to heat the air of a home interior.  The air flow rate is 2000 lbm/hr; the air enters in steady flow at 70o F and leaves the heat exchanger at 100 oF.  Heating water enters at 130oF and leaves at 110oF.  a) If the heat exchanger is operating in steady state and there is negligible heat loss from the outside casing of  the exchanger to its surroundings what is the required water flow rate? b) c) Do you think it's possible to design a heat exchanger with a water temperature drop from 130oF to 110oF while the air outlet temperature is raised to 125oF (for suitable air and water flow rates)?

7.  MIT has a large number of fume hoods used for wet chemistry experiments. When the hood sashes are open the air velocity, sometimes called the face velocity, must be maintained at a safe level to prevent any dangerous fumes from escaping. The air drawn into the hoods comes from the air supplied to the room. This air must be heated to acceptable temperature levels for the lab occupants. For safety reasons, all of the air flow in such a building must be exhausted and none can be recycled, a once-through system.  Use the instruments from class to measure the air flow rate in a new and an older hood as the window is closed.  a) b)  b)   c)  d)       Estimate for one full sized hood at MIT the energy required to heat the air use during one winter day if the hood is left fully open for 24 hours.  Use the instruments from class to measure the air flow rate in a new and older hood as the sash is closed. Estimate the amount of energy required to heat the air for the entire heating season if the hood is always open. Compare this to the energy required to heat an average single family house in Boston for the heating season. What steps would you recommend to save energy with the fume hoods at MIT?

1.  The air leaving an office space is at 78oF dry bulb and 85% relative humidity.  The leaving air is cooled to 65oF dry bulb and 70% relative humidity and returned to the office space.  This is accomplished by first sensible cooling of the air to saturation, then cooling and dehumidification along the saturation line and finally reheating without vapor addition.  Show the process on the psychometric curve.  Find the energy requirement for each of the three processes per pound of dry air.

The condition line is the line on the psychometric chart representing all of the possible states of the supply air which yields the desired well mixed conditions within the building.  The indoor conditions are maintained by mixing the ambient air, cooled by evaporation as given in problem 3, with the exhaust from the building.  What is the only state of the cooled ambient air which permits the interior conditions to be maintained, i.e. for the specified state of the interior air and the given ratio of sensible to latent heat gain?

The person is now seated in front of a large window which is cold, 50oF.  The window and the person can both be considered as a black body.  The rest of the room walls are still at 70oF.  Estimate how much the room air temperature must be increased for the person to have the same net heat loss from their entire body surface as in the original case without the window?  In both cases the surface temperature of the person is unchanged.  You will need to estimate some values of the convective and radiative heat.

You may consider work in any genre of visual art (architecture, painting, sculpture, print, drawing, photography, film, video, or new media), but choose wisely so that you can mine its potential for revealing specific aspects of an engagement with mass culture and the theories in question.  Note that engagement can consist of resistance as well as embrace, and can be located in the eye of the beholder as well as (or despite) the intention of the artist.  The first part of your paper should describe the art, and the second part should examine the theories pertinent to its interpretation.  Ideally, there will be evidence internal to the artwork that its maker was strategically utilizing ideas of modernism or postmodernism, or was tactically refusing to adopt them.  That is, ideally you will find evidence in historical material and the artwork itself that supports your claims. Effective essays will state a thesis in the first page, develop it in the body of the paper along with your analysis of the artwork, and return to it in an informed conclusion. It is expected for this major assignment that you will conduct research (in consultation with your teachers) both on and off the bibliography for this subject. As always, cite any sources with Humanities-style foot- or end-notes using an approved style.1  Internet sources must also be cited.2  Any uncited sources will be considered plagiarism. Your T.A., the Writing Advisor, your professor, and the Writing Center are all available to help.  You are strongly encouraged to use the peer review system (see Sylvan Barnet in Writing about Art). Cite your peer reviewer and your paper will receive extra credit. 1 Firstname Lastname, “Title of this essay,” Journal name Vol. No. (Date), pp. x - xx. 2 Firstname Lastname, course website,(cid:

1.  To sum up the point the paragraph is making.   
2.  To tie the paragraph back to the thesis of the paper.   If your claim sentence does not do both then it is inadequate.     Like a thesis statement, a claim sentence should be appropriately located. A claim sentence is most effective when it is the first sentence of a paragraph.    Just as a thesis should not be topic announcing, so a claim sentence should not merely announce the topic of a paragraph:  Bad claim sentence: “In The Night Cafe, Van Gogh makes great use of color.”  Good claim sentence: “In The Night Cafe, Van Gogh uses intense, saturated, and strongly contrasting colors to heighten the effect of psychological tension in his painting.”    The rest of the paragraph should do two things: (a) Explain in more detail what you mean by the claim sentence. (b) Give evidence for the claim. Here you would use your specific observations of the images you are discussing; you might use quotations; or you might refer to another author’s argument.   It is vital that material which has nothing to do with your claim should not appear in your paragraph. If it does, it will confuse your reader and will make your paragraph less clear and coherent.    If the misplaced material is important then it should have a paragraph of its own. If it is not important, cut it. 3    Never give the reader evidence (for instance, a quotation) until you have told them how to interpret it. Readers will always assume that the sentences which precede a quotation state a claim that the quotation is intended to support.   MIT OpenCourseWarehttp://ocw.mit.edu

Monographic: Go to the Museum of Fine Arts (your MIT ID gets you in for free), the Harvard Art Museums, the MIT List Visual Arts Center, the Rose Art Museum, or any other arts institution in the area and find a work on view at that dates from 1940 to the present.  Pick an artist you feel strongly about (positively or negatively), and find out everything you can about them before you write your paper.  Use library books, journal articles, the internet, newspaper reviews, radio talkshows — but cite your sources! . Analyze the work in detail . Situate this particular work in the artist's overall oeuvre then pursue one or several of the following additional points, as a motivated argument: .

Then, within this chosen theme: . Find an artist or an art movement that brings the theme into closer focus .  Analyze  the  specifics  of  the  historical  period  in  which  this  artwork,  artist,  or  art movement operated to engage with your theme then pursue one or both of the following additional points, as a motivated argument: . Argue why the artist’s (or artists’) chosen approach was successful – or unsuccessful –  as an artistic strategy.  Support your argument in either case with data about the particular reception the art received, or the specific context in which it was produced. .  Argue for the works' relevance for today’s culture.

1) Go to the following two web sites and review the information on your camera.  If there isn't an in-depth review of your specific camera, read one that's from the same manufacturer, of a model that's close:   www.dpreview.com   www.dcresource.com   Bring any questions these reviews raise to the first class, and we'll go over them, including a basic review of camera technology, functionality, and history.   
2) Review the OCW site from last year's class (no need to watch the video, unless you really have nothing to do):  
3) Bring your cameras to class. 
1) Take 20 or more images that show "good light".  More detail as to what that means can be found on the OCW site under "Major Assignment: Light".   
2) When you're done, pick your 5 favorites and email them to me no later than 9am Monday.  Try to resize them to no bigger than 800x600, and no smaller than 400x300, if you can.  This is easy using Picasa - in Tools > Options, you can set the size of images you email, and the computer will resize them for you.  Picking the "640 pixels" option would be fine.  (If you haven't resized before, and your email / photo program won't do it for you, don't worry about it - we'll show you in class.  And don't set your camera to take smaller images - always take the biggest you can.)   Picasa is here:   http://picasa.google.com/   
3) You should try to familiarize yourself with your camera and all it's options as part of this assignment. Be sure, if you see something that you think makes a great image, to take many images of it.  Odds are better when you do that one will be perfect - in focus, clear, well exposed, etc. 
1) Over the next two weeks, take 40 or more images that show "detail".  More information as to what that means can be found on the OCW site under "Major Assignment: Detail", and in the Projects page by looking at last year's student work.     Two things I should emphasize: people might be significant details, so trying to photograph them (if you have the courage, or some good friends) might make for some interesting work.  And also, if you start to see themes in your work that you'd like to pursue, please do.  Feel free to ask me questions about this, or propose things that you'd like to try.   
2) When you're done, pick 5-8 of your favorites and email them to me no later than 9am Monday, October 
1) Laying out your site  The first step has more to do with the logical organization and design of your web site.  In this step, you'll plan out how you want the site to look.  For example:  - Every web site has a home page, a page that comes up by default.  What do you want on your default page?  Perhaps your basic info, a link to your resume, and a link to any class work you need on the web.  You don't need to build all this now, but planning it out in advance is helpful.  - On your own computer's hard drive, you should create a copy of your web site.  You'll upload this whole thing later to your Web locker, using any FTP software that you have.    - To ensure a neat and easy to work with web site, you want to organize things by folders.  For example, say I want the following things on my web site: my resume, my class assignments, and a brief bio.  So my site would have the following folders:  www  - this is the top level folder.  In it, you'll put your main page (index.html), and any files that are on that page (pictures, etc.)  www\resume  - the resume page goes here (as another index.html) with all it's files.  www\bio  www\class\4a21\assn1 (Note - this folder structure is up to you, I only suggest this level of detail so that you can add other classes later, and have it be well organized.)   
2) Building HTML pages using Notepad and Macromedia Dreamweaver  Once you have a basic plan, you can start building the pages for each of these elements.  Essentially, each of these folders should have an "index.html" page in it.  To start, you  - this is where Assn 1 images from this class will go.   - the bio goes here, again as an index.html file can simply use Notepad or any other file to create a placeholder.  Open Notepad, type "This is the future home of my biography." and save that file in your "bio" folder as "index.html".   I've built this on my own site, which you can see here:  http://web.mit.edu/~kvm/www/bio/  Note that anytime you type a web address, and don't specify a page to open, web browsers will open the file "index.html" by default.  So by typing in the folder path (above), the browser automatically looks for any index pages in the bio folder.  It's important for that reason that each folder in your www directory have an index file in it (otherwise, anyone who types that path, above, will see your folder directory).   For more complex web pages, you can use Macromedia Dreamweaver to build pages with images and links to other pages.  If you've never used it before, schedule a time to sit down with me and I'll show it to you.  Feel free to try on your own, but at the slightest frustration, stop and let me know.  I don't want you to waste a lot of time on this when you have more valuable things to do.  If you are using Dreamweaver, some simple tools to use: 
3) To adjust the page properties, right-click and select "Page Properties". 
4) To insert an image, use "Menu: Insert - Image".  That should get you started.  Note that if you edit a web page in Dreamweaver, you have to save your changes and make sure the changed file is in your www locker, before you'll be able to see the changes on the web.  You'll also need to reload the web page, in order to see what you've done (F
1) Over the next week, take 40 or more images that show "poetics".  More information as to what that means can be found on the OCW site under "Major Assignment: Poetics", and in the Projects page by looking at last year's student work.     
2) When you're done, pick 5-8 of your favorites and post them on your Web site or email them to me no later than 9am Monday, November 
3) Review all the photos you've taken this term, and see if there are any themes or a single theme you'd like to pursue for the final review.  Feel free to email me if you have questions, and we'll discuss this in class.

The device must either augment, alter, distort, or re-configure an existing device for recording (ie. camera, video recorder, tape recorder, sketchbook) or invent a new means of documenting the experience of the city. The device must position an attitude about both the city and its representation. Consider aspects of time, measurement, datum, movement and transformation. The devices must be portable and constructed to be utilized by you.  The device must engage input as well as output, generating a record/mark/imprint on some(cid:

11. You must develop a concept for your design intervention out of the research you have conducted to date on the representing and recording the city. Your architectural intervention must enable its participants to re-experience the city in a new way. Your architecture must be both a space of stasis and a space of movement. You are required to trespass off the roof top boundaries anywhere between 20 -80 % You may connect to an adjacent site or cantilever over the street, how ever, you may not completely connect across 22nd Street. Atleast 30% of the structure must be enclosed from the elements. It must accommodate atleast two visitors at once.Your extended threshold must also function as an exhibition space or performance space that can be currated by the DIA. You must create a series of representation of your expanded site at 1/8” or 1/16”  scale through a casting process.  The material you choose to cast is up to you (ie. plaster, rubber, rockite, concrete, etc.). Final model to be at 1/8” scale. Final drawings to be at 1/8” scale: plan, section, perspective.

1) over 50% of the ground -scape  must be designed as a public park to be used by the sur­rounding community  
2) the project must engage the elevated highway to provide either a sound barrier or visual barrier from the rail lines 
3) the Center must provide an informal community space protected from the ele­ments for the homeless who currently frequent the area and sleep at the Pine Street Inn. As a gateway to the city, the Boston Redevelopment Authority has empha­sized to the LFPC the importance of the architectural presence from both the elevated highway as well as the park and channel.  In addition to the criteria of the BRA, the Land Form Processes Center has a significant pro­gram of its own. Furthermore, two important collections have been donated to the center: the World Coastline Collection, a collection of maps and pho­tographs of the changing world's coast lines, and the American Strata Collection, five 80' tall, 10' wide  and 3' deep geological core samples from different geological sections of the United States.   In addition to the below listed program requirements and the two above mentioned collections, the Center is mandating that the architecture acknowledge and register both the land form processes of the site, (present, past, elevated and underground) and its own intervention in the site's natural and artificial processes.  The BRA has given no restricitions on the site.  Excavation, cantilevers, building in the channel, redirecting the channel, engaging the tunnel, engaging the elevated highway, using existing infrastructure for structure are permitted.

2.  Using James Corner’s work as a reference, develop a representation (or a series) using a combination of primarily drawings/ diagrams, photograph and collage. The representations, (which should be designs in themselves), should conceptualize and communicate your reading of the site.

1. STRUCTURE - It was good that most of you have begun to explore the form and development of the structure as it relates to the larger ideas behind you project. You also need to consider how these emerging ideas relate back to the spacial order and organization through redrawing the plan. Work and think at multiple scales. 
2. SKIN - It also seemed that most of you have still to consider the nature of the skin /enclosure and how it responds to the need for environmental control. In some cases the glass was not there, and in others it was just glass without an explanation of how it works, what its properties are (clear, opaque, translucent etc) and if it is accompanied by other devices (shading, ventilation etc). I would like you to consider these aspects and incorporate them into the next stage of the assignment.     For the next assignment, I would like you to refocus upon the materiality of GLASS in your project. We reviewed this in the early stages and it is a relevant time to explore and define a deeper understanding as to how glass is being worked and crafted in the project. You should refer back to your original research into glass and consider the qualities that originally interested you.  So for completion and review on FRIDAY DECEMBER 5 -  you should select a part or element of the project that can then be fabricated and prototyped (within the time available), and that informs you about both the material qualities and the assembly. Ideally, this will be a study that follows on from the 'skin and bones' study. For example: - fabricate part of an integrated assembly - a section, panel, joint, material relationship - model the form of an entire element - such as a roof or wall design- including the layering, types of glass / solids etc - mock-up and test layering for environmental control- types of glass, fabrics, layers etc and test for light qualities  You will need to determine the scale that fits the study- but I expect these to be in the order of  2 - 3 feet  in size (and bigger if you can!) but large enough to explain the emerging material language. Remember that these prototype models are a means for you to better understand essential aspects of the design. They are working models, need not be like presentation quality models and should fell like they are mock-ups of ideas. However, expect that they will form part of your work at the final review.     Please email me and Noah your PROPOSAL for what your prototype model by the end of TODAY. I will then email back further comments and suggestions over the next couple of days. I will also be away for reviews at ASU next Tuesday, back Thursday. Speak with Noah about what you are doing and feel free to email me ideas and sketches (no big files please). It is important to keep the momentum going over the final few weeks of the semester.

2.  Be ready tomorrow for discussion of the material. 
3.  In three teams (about 2 or 3 people) the following should be done: Team 
1.  In 3 dimensions show your Attitude Form about the following: We know as much as possible about the site until we go to Havana. The next step is to ask the question “Why is this place?”. This is always the first question of good design, to first understand the issues and then design the “echo” to those ideas. This is about the following set of questions: 
2.  What kind of a program would support your ideas? 
3.  What is you position about issues of street life, private life, community 
4.  Why will this place be as exciting as the places we have seen in images life? and read about? There can be endless questions that can be added.  
1.  Document site, buildings and views from site - 6 people (six people organized into groups of two to cover areas) 
2.  Document neighborhood around site - 2 people 
3.  Document issues of light, ventilation, rain, climate - 2 people  All should be observing the site, neighborhood, and city for clues of how to make an architecture fit with climate, site, people and culture.  On Friday after we arrive back we should have a presentation and discussion of all. 
1.  At 1:500 design a new (or revise your first) plan of our area taking that fits with the site design above. The model is to  be quickly built (like a plan but in 3 dimensions) and is intended to test the site plan.  By having an idea about the large and small at the same time we will then be ready to develop a design. After this assignment we will leave the 1:500 scale. Due for next Friday for discussion.

9.  Any other material you believe is needed to clearly illustrate your design.  The four panels along with models (if you have) will be exhibited in the lobby of the building. Each team will have 15 minutes to present their design with a power point presentation. After the presentations there will be time to discuss your proposal with individual guests.  1The exhibition panels should be able to be reduced to A4 size (for the magazine) and still be legible. All illustrations should be titled and captioned to explain the drawing. See examples from last year. The major text should be in Chinese.  All panels should use a basic 3 column vertical division of space (see examples).  It is important that all work be completely finished so that on Friday the workshop is completely done, the work ready to be published.  Work should be loaded on computer by 9:15 to be ready to start at 9:30 am.  We will discuss in more detail on Monday at 9:00 am. Good luck!  2

3. and layers of woven mats made of grass acacia fibers and animal hair used for covering and decoration.  thread 02 – Stealth airplane  Recent developments in the aviation industry have led to the construction of airplanes manufactured entirely of composite materials. Making composite structures is more complex than manufacturing most metal structures. To make a composite structure, the composite material, in tape or fabric form, is laid out and put in a mold under heat and pressure. The resin matrix material flows and when the heat is removed, it solidifies. It can be formed into various shapes. In some cases, the fibers are wound tightly to increase strength. One useful feature of composites is that they can be layered, with the fibers in each layer running in a different direction. This allows materials engineers to design structures that behave in certain ways. For instance, they can design a structure that will bend in one direction, but not another. In comparison to pure materials and assemblies, composite materials present the advantage of yielding a certain kind of performance orchestrated to respond to fluctuating external circumstances, such as the different forces that will be exerted in different parts of the aircraft during flight.  thread 02 – Column by Lilian Eliot  The piece entitled "Column" is made of pandanus, rattan and acrylic paints. As Martina Margetts comments: "The apparently random structure and texture of Elliot's piece is a deceptively 'primitive' work with a controlled technique." In this case study the weaving strategy apparently defies the basic principle of weft and woof grid. The complex texture seems to emerge out of an interweaving of “threads” with different rigidity, size and color in multiple directions. Since no explanation is offered, the amount of control in this process cannot be determined.  substance 03 – turkish bow  In his History of Warfare, John Keegan observes that the bow can be seen as the first machine, since it employed moving parts and translated muscular into mechanical energy. The Turkish bow, which dates as early as 5000 years ago, is one of the first composite bows and "is consisted of a slender strip of wood or a laminate of more than one - to which were glued on the outer side (belly) lengths of elastic animal tendons and on the inner side (back) strips of compressible animal horn, usually that of the bison. The glues, compounded of boiled-down cattle tendons and skin mixed with smaller amounts reduced from the bones and skin of fish, might take more than a year to dry and had to be applied under precisely controlled conditions of temperature and humidity.  substance 03 – a new approach to rubber  Driven by the intention to yield a parallel aesthetic performance derivative from the material synthesis of the composite, the project uses as matrix of the composite a semi-transparent material, in order to reveal the inner reinforcement pattern. The material composition of the case study is rubber for the matrix and PVC coated fiberglass screen mesh over bars for the reinforcement. Although the layers of reinforcement in a composite material are conventionally used to strengthen it and augment its performance, this case exemplifies that the intricacy of reinforcement patterns can be put in effect for alternate causes, such as the creation of dense and loose areas of material. 
1) Streets Types:  Identify and draw a profile (in section, or elevation) of the various street types you observe in East Cambridge. Remember, the goal is not to document every street, but only the handful (3-4?) major types of streets that you perceive. Pace the typical streets by foot to get a sense of the width (measure your pace). Count the floors and deduce the building heights. Note the characteristics of the street using the criteria we identified in class (landscape, width, building height, transit, median, setback, etc.). Indicate on an overall plan of East Cambridge where one of each street type exists. 
2) Block Types:  Identify the typical block types of the area. Draw the plan of the block indicating the basic dimensions (including sidewalks) and, in very general terms, the parcelization of the blocks (i.e. what is the typical lot width? Are they consistent or do they vary in width?). If possible, draw the cross-section through these block types. Identify only the typical conditions rather than every block – you are tryingto distill the complex network down to only a few typical types. Indicate on anoverall plan where one of each type exist.
3) Building Types: Identify the major building types of the area. Remember, building type refers to the underlying configuration of a building, rather than its style or its use. Again, there are probably only a handful of different building types – try to distill whatyou observe down to only a few. Think of the following criteria : building size, attached/detached, relationship to street, etc. Indicate on an overall plan roughly where one of each building type exists. 
4) Open Spaces:Diagram the location and type of major open spaces of the area on a map, keepingin mind the various types
5) Land Uses: Make a diagram outlining the basic land uses (residential, commercial, retail, industrial, etc) of the area, using the standard planning color code system. The goal is not to identify every building (or even every street) but, in general, the kinds of uses you find in different parts of the city. Make a planoutlining, in general, wherevarious uses exist. 
6) Transportation:  Indicate on a map the location of the major transit nodes in and immediatelyaround the observed area.. Make note of what uses are in the immediate vicinity. How far (in walking time) is it from the major places of activities or to these transit stops?
7) Skeleton: Draw a diagram that indicates the major places and streets. Think of this as the most important places in the area. Deliverables: One page of diagrams (supplemented with very short notes) for each topic (7 pages of diagrams and point-form notes). 
1) Identify Stakeholders.  Start by identifying a long list of stakeholders – possible users of open space in Cambridge, but also groups who would be impacted by the introduction of an open space network in the city.  To get you started, consider the following stakeholders: 
2) State agencies (Metropolitan District Commission, Conservation Authorities). 
3) Transportation agencies/planners. 
4) Transit users (students, commuters, low-income residents in particular). 
5) Homeowners and renters.

1) Site Inventory and Analysis. Visit your existing site in the field and, drawing upon previous assignments, do site observation and recording (sketches, notes, photos – subjective and objective analyses).  This does not need to be handed in (just do it in your sketchbook), although you may want to scan some of your sketches for your final panels (see 5 below). 
2) Prepare Base Plans. Prepare analysis plans, in either digital form or hand-drawn, which depict the site conditions and opportunities/constraints as related to your specific open space proposal.  You will need to download or otherwise find a base plan of your specific site at a reasonable scale (this should be a line drawing).  Scan or download any images you might find useful – these might be images of similar open spaces that you feel might be influential on your design, or photos that you took of the site.  On 11”x17” prepare the following plans (refer to the Graphic Reference Book - please remember to have titles (typed), labels (typed), a graphic scale and north arrow): a) Context Plan: This plan should locate your site in the context of Cambridgeport/East Cambridge, drawing a series of concentric rings of walking distances surrounding your site, rendering (and labeling) important overall features of Cambridgeport/East Cambridge,  (see sample).  b) Existing Conditions Plan: This plan should indicate in detail the current situation on the site.  Indicate circulation types and routes, land uses and districts, key landmarks, activities, vegetation, views, etc.  Remember to properly label important features and observations (see sample).  c) Opportunities/Constraints Plan:  This plan should be your response to the existing conditions plan – not a design response, but the potential opportunities and constraints that come out of your analysis.  At minimum, it should indicate the “envelope” of where you intend to intervene, vegetation patches, unique site features, site entries/exits, major/minor views, which uses are linked, etc. (see sample). 
3) Design Program. Produce a 1 page (max.) written design program.  The design program is a clearly organized set of written statements and tables, articulating the objectives of your design and the site development potential.   The written statement is one where the designer clearly articulates how he/she expects a certain space to perform.  This statement is based on your site analysis and should contain the set of goals that you have formulated.  It should include objectives for spaces/structures location, size, form, activities and quality of experience.  For example: “Maintain natural surface drainage and riparian vegetation.  Use area for trails and recreation.  Design should respond to natural conditions, be low-key and maintain rustic appearance.” The tables should include a list and description of the different facilities/ amenities/structures, their specific square footage or acreage, their number, ideal location and design considerations.  For example: References: Harris and Dines.  Time Saver Standards For Landscape Architecture.  New York: McGraw Hill, 
4) Concept Plan. Drawing upon the rendering exercises, the graphic reader and the landscape plans we passed around in class (in books), prepare a diagrammatic plan showing your suggested design scheme.  Be sure to render your plan using appropriate colors, shades, textures, etc., label all relevant spaces and features (type), show major pathsand trails, important visual connections, etc. This plan should be simple enough to convey the major ideas, without too much detail (see sample). 
5) Design. Refine your concept plan into a detailed site plan.  Draw 2 site sections (typically, one in perpendicular directions, i.e. a cross-section and a longitudinal section).  Illustrate impressions of you space through a couple of vignettes (3D sketches orphoto collages of how you see your open space). The whole package should be assembled into two 36” x 24” panels which should be laid out on your favorite layout program (Powerpoint, InDesign, etc): 
1) Project Type 
2) Special Features and General Description 
3) Planning Process and Financing 
4) Design/Construction 
5) Images 
6) Site Information, including: a) Site area in acres (% buildings, % roads/parking % open space) Total # of dwelling units. Density (units per acre). Total # of parking spaces (broken into on and off street). 
7) What you gained from the experience – for example: a) Relation to natural features, resources, site sensitivity. b) Regional and local context of the development. c) Organization and structure (scale, pattern, density, variety). d) Circulation for vehicles and pedestrians (access, size, traffic volume). e) Building size, type and style. f) Land and building maintenance (upkeep, cost). g) Social equity (diversity, manipulative, safety). h) Cultural and historical impacts.

1.  The City would like to develop the site to its maximum potential, in accordance with its current zoning, urban design guidelines, and development plan for the area.  The City would like to see at least 60% of the square footage be developed as housing.  The proposed development site is located within the Cambridgeport Revitalization District.  The zoning ordinance for this district allows a diverse land use in close proximity within a limited area; encourages a transition from the existing residential neighborhoods to business oriented uses, and interaction among activities, while providing for mixed income residential, as an extension of the Cambridgeport neighborhood.  Purpose:   To introduce students to the design process for an urban infill project.  To develop an understanding of some of the factors that influence design decisions.  To prepare presentation panels, in order to convey ideas in a convincing and graphic manner. To supplement their graphic presentation with a concise oral explanation of the proposal.  Task:   To prepare a design proposal for the site that meets the City’s objectives and development framework for the site.  Information on the parameters for the site are as follows:  Zoning  The zoning regulations for the site are comparable to those designated in Office District no. 
2.  DIAGRAM 
1.  Pick an actual program that has been designed and implemented to pursue a policy in your field of interest.  Dissect the program using the concepts of the course (i.e., the tools approach to program design).  Speculate about works well in this program, and what might not work so well.  Finally, design an improved program.  Please be sure that your paper is linked to the readings for the course.  
2.  Pick a problem in your field of interest that policy might address.  Then, using each tool one at a time consider how each tool might be used alone to address this problem.  Finally, design a program that is a hybrid—that uses several tools together—that you feel would be more effective than any of the tools by themselves.  Please be sure that your paper is linked to the readings for the course.  You are certainly invited to propose a third style of paper, but please discuss it with Mark before you get too far into it. 
1.   Choose a place within the Boston Metropolitan Area which has undergone significant physical change through its history, particularly over the past 10-20 years.  The area should be larger than a single building or site, and should involve multiple ownership (an institution is not appropriate).  A block of the inner city would be appropriate, or a section of the waterfront, or a two to five acre suburban site.  The changes it has undergone might be positive or negative, but must be observable.  And choose an area that interests you a great deal, since the job of digging up information on it may take considerable effort.    Assignment 1, page 2  
2.  
3. Document the evolution of your area through time.  Develop a set of "snapshots" of the area at key points in time during which significant changes occurred -- not necessarily intervals of equal duration.  Documentation should include both illustrations (maps, sketches, photos, or other media) of the physical environment showing patterns of development, architectural typologies, etc., as well as descriptions and data about the changing nature of the area and its role in the city.   Discuss the key forces which resulted in physical and functional change.  These forces may include, for example, changes in the economic function of the place, social structure, introduction of new public infrastructure, changes in the rules of development, or application of a particular vision of the city in your area of study.  Try to describe the motivation behind these forces and the particular effects in your area.   9-12-06    
4.   Predict the future of your area.  Evaluate the forces for change which are now active.  Consider if these are a consequence of the historical chain of events which have effected this place over many years, or whether a whole new set of forces and interactions are now in play.  Interviews of residents, business owners, and others with a stake in the area would be a good way of supplementing written data.  Observations of building conditions, recent construction or other signs of change would also be helpful.  Based upon your analysis, try to predict what changes will be likely to occur at this location over the next 10-20 years.   Product  Document you findings in a brief paper, no more than 15-20 pages in length, including any data and illustrations you may wish to include.  Be sure to include a one-page summary of your conclusions up front.   The assignment should be done individually.  To help you get started, we have assembled a preliminary bibliography that identifies sources on the development of Boston organized by various forces which have affected the city over time.  You should also obtain a copy of Whitehill's Topographical History of Boston as a general reference for the assignment.  Nancy Seasholes’s Gaining Ground is another good source.  Robert Campbell's Cityscapes of Boston: An American City Through Time, and Lois Craig’s Images of Boston, may be helpful in identifying potential areas for study.  Please be prepared to identify the place that you are studying during Session

6.  	Choose a plan for an area in a city that interests you.  The plan may be for the area of Boston that you studied in Assignment 1 or for a district in any other city.  The plan you focus on may be  relatively  recent  or  may  have  been  created  several  decades  ago.    It  should  have  been developed long enough ago so that the results can be observed, however.  Choose a plan that proposes changes in physical form as well as changes in activities or policies to be applied in the area.  Finally, choose a plan for which you can speak with one or more of the actors who created it, or about which enough has been written so that it is possible to draw conclusions. Describe the nature of the plan and the reasons why it was prepared.  What problems or issues was the plan intended to address?  Who were the constituents for the plan? Discuss the process used to develop the plan.  Under whose authority was the plan prepared and carried out?  Were the constituents involved and to what degree was their involvement reflected in the plan? What model(s) of design and development underlay the plan?  This may be one of the models will discuss in class or another precedent that you feel had a strong influence on the plan.  Was the model appropriate to the problem? Was the plan effective?  In making this assessment, look for long term changes in the district that  were  motivated  by  the  plan.    These  may  be  changes  in  form,  activities  or  social composition, but they may also be more subtle changes in attitudes or perceptions about a place which have long term impacts.  How well did the  plan anticipate and affect the future? Finally,  answer  the  question:  "Is  this  a  good  plan?"   Discuss  your  criteria  for  making  this judgment. Your paper should not exceed 12-15 pages, including text and any graphics you may wish to include.  This assignment is due in class during Session

1)  The ‘original’ time of the building when it was built in 1561 
2)  Colonial preservation efforts of the ASI under the aegis of the British imperial powers 
3)  Its modern designation as a World Heritage Site.  This essay introduces the ‘initial’ moment of the building at the time of its construction and the process  by  which  selective  memories  were  associated  with  the  structure  to  establish  and consolidate the political status of the patron, Akbar. Location and site surroundings: The tomb is situated on a flat stretch of land on the outskirts of urban Delhi today. Historically, the site  was  located  next  to  the  banks  of  the  river  Yamuna,  surrounded  by  numerous  sultanate  and Mughal monuments but outside the urban realm of Mughal Delhi. The rubble walls of the city of Din-Panah built by Humayun in 1533 are 1500 meters to the north. Barely 600 meters to the west is the dargah and village settlement of Nizamuddin Auliya (one of the most revered Chisti sufi-saint of India). 1   The location of the tomb in that particular site opens the discussion of constructing political power through monuments. It is my contention that the tomb was located in that particular site primarily due to two factors- 
4.                                                  1 Akbar is known to have been a firm disciple of the Chisti tradition of Sufism, of which Nizamuddin Auliya was a noted religious figure.   2 Loosely translated, ‘ziyarat’ means the act or place of performing pilgrimage. 3 The recorded imperial visits by Akbar and successive Mughal rulers has been studied and discussed in detail by Ebba Koch. 4 Jizya was the discriminatory poll tax imposed on the people of the state outside of the Islamic faith. Akbar abolished this tax during his reign and  in doing so established the rudiments of what later became a very secular and tolerant Islamic empire. The building can therefore be considered a memorial to the expansion and the establishment of the vast Mughal Empire in India, a symbol of a vision of kingship and an affirmation of the Mughal power  and  permanence  in  India.  Through  its  particular  aesthetic  articulation,  it  can  also  be considered as embodiment of the secular principles promoted by Akbar. Some of these, particularly the absence of Quranic calligraphy, are discussed later in the paper. Hence, we see that the physical form taken by the monument was in certain ways a product of the political environment of the time and reciprocally it was a true expression of the political scenario of the times.   It  has  been  argued  by  some  scholars  that  the  building  was  actually  built under  the  patronage  of Humyun’s widow, Haji begum. But this has been proven incorrect by later studies, as well as the physical evidence of the building itself.5 A monument of this stature and significance can only be attributed to Akbar, who alone would have had the resources for its construction and its fashioning in that particular architectural/aesthetic manner.  Form and meaning: One of the eye-catching features of the tomb is its raised plinth that is the cause of its visibility on the city skyline today. But historically its importance lay in the 56 cells housed within that raised plinth  and  that  were  used  as  the  burial  place  of  almost  100  royal  descendants  and  relatives.  By making the tomb a large structure that could house innumerable royal dignitaries etc, Akbar added another dimension of meaning to the structure as a tomb. For not only did the tomb become the resting place of Humayun, it became a dynastic center of sorts. Akbar’s need to associate himself with not only his father but also the entire royal family was to strengthen his legality as the true descendant to the Mughal Empire in India.  The  built  form  of  the  building  (especially  the  dome),  though  apparently  derived  from  existing Sultanate  and  Timurid  examples,  is  distinct  from  either.  It  attempts  to  fuse  together  the  formal aspects  of  both  these  types.  By  doing  so  he  established  a  link  as  the  successor  to  the  glorious Timurid’s  of  Iran  as  well  as  the  Islamic  empire  in  India.  The  use  of  red  sandstone  with  white marble is a reference to the previous architecture of the Delhi Sultanate and places the building as a logical continuation in the same tradition.6                                                   5 For details about the assumption of Akbar as true patron of the tomb, refer to the arguments in Glenn D.Lowry, “Humayun's Tomb: Form, Function, and Meaning in Early Mughal Architecture,” Muqarnas IV: An Annual on Islamic Art and Architecture 1987 (Oleg Grabar, ed. Leiden: E.J. Brill). 6 For details about the Islamic building tradition in India till that time, refer to James Frergusson, History of Indian and Eastern Architecture, vol. 2 (1876; reprint New Delhi,

1.  Framing ‘large scale” general goals  (Class) The class (as a whole) should establish general goals for the project’s design/plan. These goals should emphasize performance (ie not necessarily a set of, “this is what we want” but “this is the performance that we want”) These should be larger in scale and scope, for example: “Create integrated/diffused natural infrastructure networks that require less energy input yet perform at a known and desirable standard” “Configure structures; make use of appropriate plant material and shape topography to lessen energy use for heating and cooling” Task 
2.  Prioritize and reassess alternative technologies (Class) The class (as a whole) should reexamine the 10 technologies/criteria we have worked on through the course of this semester. You should decide whether all should remain, or if less relevant ones should be negated, and if there are others that should be included. The current topics/technologies are:Waste Water Systems: sewersWaste Water Systems grey waterStorm Water SystemsStreams, Water Body  RestorationsEnergy supply (and reduction) technologies at the community level.Food production technologies at the community level.Passive and active climate mitigationMobility and travelInnovative Materials  (surface , paving, walls)Earthworks – SoilsTask 
3) Process: - Define your specific Goals /Objectives - Generate a list of Challenges and Opportunities - Generate a priority list/matrix This is not about doing everything. Ask yourself why do you want to do it? Eg:  why do you want local agriculture? Local ownership or living off the land, etc. Think about flexibility vs. optimization.  If it’s too flexible, nothing is optimized (ie If you take flexibility to the extreme you may end up with a bare bones system. What is flexibility within a range? Consider limitations and tradeoffs Such a matrix could be divided into four categories: Scale/Objectives/Actions/Examples - Generate a list of principles (eg “create riparian areas and vegetation buffers along reconstructed stream and floodplain” “revegitate streams with native species to improve the valley’s Biodiversity” etc.) Product: Note: scale and graphics to be determined (all of which must be coordinated for graphic and written consistency (scale, colors, fonts etc)) -----Typical (4-

1. Describe the Infinite Corridor here at MIT. What do you see? What is going on? Keep track of the questions you pose for yourself. Put this aside.   What are the elements and the relations that are important in each of the descriptions? What are the similarities and differences? Try to address some of the questions posed above.   Choose the medium you feel is most appropriate. You should assume that you will have 5 minutes to present it. Tell us about what you will need for your presentation.   Assignment-Part II:  Choose two of the essays in the readings below, and write a one or two page essay (with illustrations if you like) of how that author -- as seen through that essay --would have written about the Infinite Corridor.  
2. Write as if you were the author and construct a narrative in their voice that they might have written about it. Try to become completely absorbed in their world and in their manner of speaking. A fragment of an essay for each, say 150-200 words would be plenty.  In the class discussion we shall compare and contrast how the environment might be changed to satisfy each author’s apparent needs, to meet their implied standards of excellence, and to give them pleasure.   Readings:  Lyford's The Airtight Cage;  Jacobs's Life and Death of Great American Cities;  Durrell's essay on Montevideo in the Spirit of Place,  Mitchell's Bit Cities (any part)   
3. Prepare a set of shape transformation rules that guides assembling of the components. Try to design a set that can re-produce the original graphics, and also can create other variations of the same style.  A simple rule indicates how one component is added to another.  C1 -> C1 + C2 (adding a room C2 next to another C1, for example)  Its variation can be  C1 + C2 -> C1 + C2 + C3 (inserting a wall C3 between columns C1 and C2, for example)  A more complex approach is to use abstract markers. For example, you can represent a linear plan of special end conditions by a set below.  M1 -> M2 + M3 + M2 (M1 represents the whole. M2 are ends, M3 is the middle.)  M2 -> C1 (M2 can be replaced by the component C
4. If your group is large, you may divide the designers into sub-groups and let each sub-group prepare a set of rules.  
5. Prepare a design problem which the players will solve through applications of the rules. For example, if the original graphics is a plan, you can provide its basic program such as the number of rooms required and the size of the building. If there are many players, you may give each a slightly different program.  
6. Do NOT reveal the original graphics to the players.  Players: Solve the design problem made by the designers. Try producing one or more alternative solutions.  Each design solution must be generated through applications of the rules prepared by the designers. The players must not be shown the original graphics. If a player feels that a rule absolutely needs to be modified/added, document your reasoning and what your modification does to the outcome of your design solution.  Medium: You can use any drafting software or Photoshop as a game board. If you want to avoid digital, use paper or transparency.  Presentation: Include the followings.  - the original graphics selected  - illustration of rules made by the designers  - description of the design problem prepared by the designers  - illustration of the design solutions made by the players  - illustration of the design development through applications of the rules by the players

1. Explain how the logic of the "Big House" and "Slave Quarters" might have structured an entire territorial system in the United States. Sprawl - the New Mt. Vernon Ophelia Wilkins   I read the phrase “territorial system” on two levels: a physical configuration such as the juxtaposition of the “Big House” to the “Slave Quarters”; Or an attitude of territoriality – an obsession with privacy and property which both the “Big House” and the “Slave Quarters” sought, but neither achieved. While specific physical configurations reminiscent of the “Big House”/”Slave Quarters” dichotomy exist in the U.S., territoriality is the lasting legacy of southern estates in our communities.  Carl Anthony presents the “Big House”/”Slave Quarters” dichotomy in his description of Mt. Vernon: “The mansion is flanked by large trees, emphasizing the importance of the big house, making it distant and monumental, while at the same time screening the dependencies.” Anthony quotes a guidebook as saying “only a carefully developed plan could have subordinated them [the slaves] in such proximity to the main household and, at the same time, incorporated them as harmonious units of the group.” Therefore, my literal read of “territorial system” is a physical juxtaposition of social strata resulting in tension. In Washington D.C., urban areas with some of the worst living conditions in the country are physically adjacent to government headquarters. Most likely, many who live in these poor neighborhoods are societal servants, allowing the city – and therefore the nation’s government – to function smoothly. Not surprisingly, D.C. consistently has one of the highest crime rates in the country. Ironically, Anthony quotes Washington Irving as saying “ A large Virginia estate was a little empire. The mansion house was the seat of government, with its numerous dependencies, such as kitchens, smoke house, [etc.]” (article 1, p. 
1) obtain the exercise of power at the lowest cost – economically and politically through its discretion and relative invisibility; 
2) bring the effects of this social power to maximum intensity and extend them as far as possible; and 
3) link this growth of power with the institutional apparatuses (in this case, commercial enterprise and state control). However, just as Bentham brought light and individual separation to a previously dungeon-based imprisonment system in order to improve discipline, the strategies for internet surveillance must allow communication among the masses. What was once a weakness now becomes the means to expose criminal and/or unethical activity or political dissent. We have come to describe the accumulation of knowledge as the Information Age. In a democratic sense, this term connotes the dissemination of power to the masses, but the new technologies of spyware allow for the inverse centralization of power through vast repositories of knowledge in the service of commercial growth and state control. 
1. Compare and contrast Walter Benjamin's and Sigfried Giedion's respective interpretations of iron construction. Giedion as Benjamin's History Ophelia Wilkins To compare Benjamin’s and Giedion’s interpretations of iron construction is neither to correlate nor contrast the two, but to observe the evolutionary mechanism of history at work. Giedion’s interest is to document the role of iron as a new building material which precipitated the advancement of an era. Benjamin, writing in the midst of two world wars, and an international depression, seems to be seeking lessons from history at a time when the whole world is looking for hope, and finds the inspiration he is looking for in Giedion’s writings on iron construction.  In “Building in Ferroconcrete” Giedion presents the emergence and evolution of iron as he has observed it, reporting with journalistic fidelity the controversies and discussions surrounding the material throughout. Perhaps because he lived through this dynamic era, he takes the opportunity to ruminate on a lifetime, pausing occasionally to extract grains of truth and to underscore moments of historical gravity he hopes not to be forgotten. For example, he witnesses history repeating itself within his own life and suggests: “It seems that in the human organism certain attitudes develop that only later crystallize in reality. Just as industry was recognized as the fulcrum of the century before the development of mechanical engineering, so, too – on a reduced scale – is a housing form today emerging before the social structure is ready for it.” (p. 
1)  Weber’s theory of the disenchantment of the world (from his 1919 lecture Wissenschaft als Beruf) and Walter Benjamin’s Arcades Project provide the underpinning of Wohlfarth’s study.(
2) Both Weber and Benjamin locate the aesthetic crisis of the 19th century in a loss of sublime meaning and monumentality precipitated by the dislocation of the value of the original, hand-wrought object as craft became mechanized and the technology of construction overtook the art of design.  In the case of architecture and aesthetics, the loss of the value of the original object (Benjamin’s loss of aura, or Baudelaire’s halo) came from a transition from craftsmanship to machine-produced kits-of-parts. The steel and concrete buildings of the 19th century seemed to lack of the labor-intensive craft traditionally associated with beauty, a fact that was often covered up with the ‘phantasmagorias’ of Wohlfarth’s title. As Wohlfarth notes, “architecture was beginning to emancipate itself from art in its use of iron construction” and the separation of building from art presented an aesthetic challenge.(
3) One early response to this challenge was the covering up of this substitution of the location of value from man to machine. The bourgeoisie’s (as Wohlfarth cites Giedion’s phrase) “historicizing masks”, result in a denial of the substructure and thus the new technology through various ornamental devices, but also through a cultural fixation upon inwardness and interiority. Wohlfarth attributes the interiority to Weber, Baudelaire, Marx and Benjamin’s warning that “[T]he failure to acknowledge this basic world-historical fact of “disenchantment” is likely to result in a surrogate re-enchantment of the world.”(
4) Wohlfarth notes that for Weber and Baudelaire, “phony spirituality is equated with reified materiality” as the traces of dwelling are systematically erased from the public sphere and the home becomes a shrine for the signs of occupation.(
5) This interior coziness masks a discomfort with the cold structure that underlies the interior, be it the Freudian subconscious, or literally steel girders. What would become recognized later as this “dishonest relation” between façade and substructure can be witnessed, for example, in Gustave Eiffel’s Statue of Liberty, wherein the “art” is a superstructural envelope hiding the technology that made it possible.  By examining early modern writings on architecture and aesthetics, Wohlfarth connects the underpinnings of modernism with the its critiques of the 19th century architecture, which were in turn based upon 19th century philosophical ideas about the aesthetic imperatives of the industrial revolution and the alienation of labor. The legacies of “honesty”, of uniting substructure and superstructure, of exposing the interior to transparency, and of creating works representative of the age of their production stem from the critiques that Wohlfarth assembles for us.  
1. Can you discern some critical distinctions between critiques of ornament in the 19th century and those in the 20th? Describe by using one building that you would offer as an example of each.  A condemnation of ill-founded form making Nathalie Westervelt Attitudes towards ornament change from 19th – 20th centuries from the creation of pattern books and analytical cataloging of those patterns to the use of morphology, a direct relationship between biological patterns and ornament, to the negation of ornament by Modernists. The “European fascination with Islamic ornament” or ornament in general “had its roots in the medieval and renaissance periods” and “it reached its peak in the nineteenth century.” (Necigoplu

2)  
3. Symptomatic: Ornament betrayed anxieties about the rapid industrialization of architecture. What would such a list look like of ornament in the late 19th and 20th centuries look like? What about a list made of ornament today? And what of distinctions to be made between “good” and “bad” ornament, and its use thereof? Rather than attempt to answer these questions directly, I will propose instead to examine ornament as an aspect of a particular building system. A column, for instance, has a structural aspect—or function—which is to transfer loads to the ground. Let us call this its “physical” function. This is not, by anyone’s definition, an ornamental function. But the column has other aspects—other functions—and has a material presence “in the world”. The column organizes space around it, and transfers its loads in a particular manner according to its geometry and material. While simple economics or engineering or other such circumstance may have dictated some of its resolution, let us assume that the column can still be considered the “product” or intention of a discrete author or authors, and that its design reveals in some manner, positively or negatively, the values and intentions of these authors. The column has been constructed according to some set of rules—some design—and those rules respond to aspects beyond the “simply” physical or structural requirements of load transfer. A Nervi column is not the same as a Mies column which is not the same as a Corb column, although all presumably transfer vertical loads. Each column does not look like the other, and does not perform the same role (structural or otherwise) in exactly the same manner. A Nervi column organizes space differently than a Mies column, just as a (chromed) cruciform Mies column organizes space differently than an I or H-section Mies column. And each “communicates” something differently than the other. It is the column “as we perceive it” which performs these functions, which is to say, we can distinguish these aspects as being “sensory” rather than purely physical or structural. It these particular aspects of any building system (but not the building as a whole) which I submit can be considered ornamental in contemporary architectural practice. Again, it is an aspect of the element, or system, that can be understood as ornament, not a system or element itself. Cladding systems, for example, have a physical aspect (not necessarily structural but certainly environmental. But that same cladding, as a perceived element, has other, “non-physical” functions. It has other, sensory, aspects: its shape and surface conditions, its 3-dimensional geometry, its tactility. It is in these aspects—the Surface, Formal, and the Extravisual—that architecture becomes, always, ornament.  The matrix below outlines my proposal. “System” categories should be self-explanatory, except perhaps by “Identification” by which I mean signage and other textual elements.  Most systems have examples of all three ornamental aspects, although some may not.

1. In the demographic upheavals created in the wake of the industrial revolution, "morality" became one of the key areas of concern for those seeking to manage social behavior efficiently. Describe some of the spatial responses to this perceived moral turpitude of the "industrial classes".    Katherine James’ response  The industrial revolution brought a population explosion in city and accompanying overcrowding, poor work conditions, and inadequate sanitation. The physical dirtiness and resultant poor physical health was evident. What is interesting is the associative assessment of the city as a place of moral degradation. “For where overcrowding exists in its sanitary sense, almost always it exists even more perniciously in certain moral senses” (Evans, 
1. How do you see larger social notions regarding gender and domesticity affecting the work of any one architect? Take one building or one architect, not included in the readings or discussion, and illustrate. The World's Most Famous Home Elizabeth Nguyen As a symbol of larger social notions of gender and domesticity, The White House in Washington, D.C. deserves special consideration. Designed by James Hoban for George Washington, the home of the president and the office of the president easily co-existed in the same mansion. As offices in the U.S. became less and less domestic, however, pressure grew to separate the office function from the president’s domestic life and the West Wing was constructed in 
2) The Roosevelts fought against political pressure to move the President’s residence to another location, instead supporting the creation of the West Wing for the offices of the President. In the main building, within the domestic sphere of the second level, Edith Roosevelt established the Office of the First Lady, officially recognizing her role in orchestrating the social functions of the White House while still not transgressing into the public area of the president’s office. In fact, even the master stair to the second floor was moved to restrict public access to the domestic sphere.  While Caroline Harrison and later Edith Roosevelt contributed significantly to the arrangement of domestic spaces and their separation from the official spaces of the White House, the legacy they left has become a museological and decorative one. For example, Jacqueline Kennedy introduced scholarship into the decorative history of the White House, and first lady Laura Bush designed the current carpet in the Oval Office. However, the more radical moves of Dolly Madison could have only occurred during a time when the larger social definition of the “office” remained partly domestic in character. 
3. Many of the facts of this essay come from Sarah Fayen,“Inhabiting an Icon: First Ladies and the White House” in Blueprints Magazine, Winter 
1)  In her essay, Interior, Beatriz Colomina describes the anxiety of the male subject in the public realm of the city. The above is a passage taken from the essay, in which Colomina reads/interprets a photograph taken in 1901 of Loos’ Goldman & Salatsch men’s store. The men in this photograph suffer from the ambiguity of their role as men in a place lacking spatial and social order. The public, or exterior, is defined by Benjamin throughout his Arcades Project as a space of potential debauchery. The loss of control of the male subject in the public realm is enhanced by such lures as prostitution and gambling, as suggested in the Arcade’s chapter bearing the same name: “That the number of filles publiques at first seems very great is owning to a sort of phantasmagoria produced by the comings and goings of these women along a routine circuit, which has the effect if multiplying them to infinity…” (
2)  In response to this loss of control, and subsequent questioning of masculinity, Colomina describes Loos’ domestic interiors as exhibiting (the illusion) of the control of the male through the gaze. Of course these spaces have inherent within them the potential for subverting the control of the male inhabitant, as the user of the space is manipulated by the slippage within the plan. It is here that the distinction between object and subject is no longer fixed. (
3) It is in the theater boxes of Loos’ domestic interiors, those spaces identified as female spaces (

1. How does the “capture” of the body by a scopophilic regime or gaze transform its functioning in space and power?  Nicole Vlado scopophilia : a desire to look at sexually stimulating scenes especially as a substitute for actual sexual participation: sexual stimulation or satisfaction from looking at naked people, most often without their knowledge; a love of looking at people in this way; also called scoptophilia, voyeurism “…the French term for pregnant, enciente, meaning walled or enclosed, was preferred by many doctors in England.” (
2)  “Agoraphobia and anorexia are, after all, chiefly disorders if middle and upper middle-class women – women for whom the anxieties of possibility have arisen, women who have the social and material resources to carry the language of femininity to symbolic excess.” (
3) The flâneur and the voyeur are perhaps the same character. Through his habit of walking, the flâneur observes/sees that which surrounds him. He transforms the exterior into an interior – a home in which he feels comfort, despite the surrounding activities and crowds. Glass architecture provides additional visibility, as the barrier between interior and exterior dissolves during the 19th century. Views are provided along the city streets, and watching [women] becomes an activity of the public sphere. It is in this same landscape that the middle-class woman begins to fear the exterior.  Agoraphobia, originally meaning the fear of the agora or marketplace, became more generally defined through Freudian psychoanalysis to mean the fear of urban spaces (

1. How does the theme park offer us a mirror to the city? Can the two be separated? James Smith Coney Island: The Technology of the Fantastic  “Coney Island is the incubator for Manhattan’s incipient themes and infant mythology. The strategies and mechanisms that later shape Manhattan is tested in the laboratory of Coney Island before they finally leap toward the larger island. Coney Island is a fetal Manhattan.”(
2) "This piece of theming has fallen off the wall."  "Iron ride" - A ride with little or no theming.  Nate Naversen, The Imagination Portal  http://www.themedattraction.com/index.  The Theme Park is a symbol of American culture suggesting new approaches to the real world beyond the entrance gates. Today’s urban exits, the shopping mall and the resort, are directly connected to the fantasy world of the theme park. The consumption of goods is the spectacle and the arcade provides the isolation of reality, allowing for an escape from the ‘real-world’. They represent an isolated experience celebrating entertainment and fantasy, appealing to the consumer and changing society’s expectations of the urban landscape.  The Escalator is the new “Iron Ride”  Recently the Shopping Mall has entered the urban landscape, the arcade of the mall has been removed and what is left is an open forum of consumption represented by such examples as Harvard Square and Newbury Street in Boston and New York’s Times Square. Consumption is the entertainment and the fantasy. Katherine James’ response One might assume that the appropriate respite from the harshness of urban life after the second machine age might be a return to nature, to that which is essential and organic. Instead there was an insatiable thirst to push the urban model still further, to take it to fantastic extremes in the leisure setting of the theme/ amusement park. We see this in the development of Coney Island: “To survive as a resort-- a place offering contrast—Coney Island is forced to mutate: it must turn itself into the total opposite of Nature, it has no choice but to counteract the artificiality of the new metropolis with its own Super-Natural” (Koolhaas, 
1. What is power in architecture? Explicate this through the relationships of the state, clients, architects, the function of design, architecture's audience, the public sphere, architecture as a social field, etc.? Lilly Donohue In “The Scenes of the Street: Transformations in Ideal and Reality, 1750-1871”, Anthony Vidler describes the thinking behind the redesign of the factory town undertaken by Robert Owen in 1800; “…By excluding streets, alleyways, and courtyards, it would naturally exclude the vices displayed in such environments: by emulating the form of the monastic precinct and the college court, it united the virtues of morality and learning and, by providing a center toward which the entire community was turned, it concretized the very image of harmony and unity for the new social world. For the street, harbinger of every social ill, was substituted the cloister; the meditative walks of the past reinvoked for the secular purposes of the future.” 1 In his idealism, Owen believed that the actual architecture and planned space in which people resided could actively shape their morality. This notion of architecture and planning as an authoritative method of rehabilitating social problems and, by extension, resisting the germination of deviance has persisted throughout the last two centuries. Clearly, the general principal of providing a clean and organized environment for all, regardless of economic or social standing is beneficial, yet the application of these ideas so commonly fails. This failure is evident in the inner city housing projects in the United States. Public parks, which Robert Owen viewed as utopian environments to promote health and activity, have been wholly appropriated in impoverished neighborhoods as the center of deviance. In many instances these parks have become more dangerous to traverse after dark than the dreaded alley Owen sought to eliminate. Additionally, the highly regular and ordered architectural responses to this housing problem, intended to provide clarity and equality are often perceived by the occupants as an unwelcome attempt by the state to exert control over this powerless population. As a result they are frequently vandalized and destroyed. Similarly, the problem of squatter settlements in developing countries has been impossible to eliminate despite persistent attempts by planners and architects over the last several decades. These settlements are perceived as dangerous and unhealthy by the authorities because they are chaotic in their planning, have poor ventilation and waste management, and are encouraging of deviant behavior. However, the endless attempts to correct these conditions by establishing a coherent and sanitary architecture and planning have, in the majority of instances, been met with resistance. Ultimately, the inhabitants have rejected a prescribed architecture which seeks to improve their quality of life and have persisted in maintaining and expanding these informal settlements.  Deviance in these instances, is the result of a complicated network of issues; poverty, education, environment, etc. Architecture and planning, regardless of how ordered and hopeful its implementation, is ultimately not capable of single-handedly preventing or correcting any particular behavior. Architecture of the state can be used to resist or exert control in the physical sense (barricades, prisons), but when it attempts to intervene in the psychology of the individual in order to exert its control, it cannot be effective without a simultaneous attempt to assist in the larger issues that contribute equally to the propensity towards deviance.

1.  After visiting each household in their defined public health sector (A) during the months of July-August, your team of healthcare monitors documents 40 cases of an unusual skin rash associated with headaches.  Sector A is comprised of 500 households located in one section of the city of Boston.  What information does your team need so that they can develop estimates of the prevalence and incidence of skin rashes in sector A?  
2. The team leader for sector B calls you because you are team leader of sector A.  The B leader wants to know if your team has observed any case of an unusual skin rash associated with headaches.  Leader B reports that they have  observed  60  cases  in  their  1000  households.    You  both  also  relate  that  95%  of  the  observed  cases  are children.  What information do you need to determine whether your sector has a greater problem than sector B?

From national surveys or childhood behavior, you learn that for kids who always drink water at playgrounds, 80% will visit the playground ≥ 3 days a week; and for kids who never drink playground water, 80% never go to the park more than 3 days a week.  Design  the  highest  quality  test  for  detecting  kids  exposed  to  playground  water  based  on  asking  kids  (or  their parents) how many days they go to the playground each week.  Determine the following properties of your test: Sensitivity Specificity Positive Predictive Value Negative Predictive Value

6. How much of the risk of skin rash/headache in kids in these communities can be attributed to their drinking playground water?  Given that this is a “new illness,” how do you explain the fraction that is not attributable to drinking playground water? 
1.  After visiting each household in their defined public health sector (A) during the months of July-August, your team of healthcare monitors documents 40 cases of an unusual skin rash associated with headaches.  Sector A is comprised of 500 households located in one section of the city of Boston.  What information does your team need so that they can develop estimates of the prevalence and incidence of skin rashes in sector A?  Answer:  The number of individuals at risk (i.e., population) is needed for both estimates. 
2. The team leader for sector B calls you because you are team leader of sector A.  The B leader wants to know if your team has observed any case of an unusual skin rash associated with headaches.  Leader B reports that they have  observed  60  cases  in  their  1000  households.    You  both  also  relate  that  95%  of  the  observed  cases  are children.  What information do you need to determine whether your sector has a greater problem than sector B?  Answer:  It  appears  that  kids  are  the  primary  at  risk  group.    You  need  to  know  the  age  distribution  of sectors A and B so that you can either compare the “kid-specific” prevalence and incidence (per answer to number 
3.  Further investigation reveals that the rash/headache illness in sectors A and B last for only three days.  What feature of your data would you evaluate to determine the current state of this epidemics progression?  Answer: Incidence versus time.

Determine the following properties of your test: Sensitivity Specificity Positive Predictive Value Negative Predictive Value    Answer: The percentage data define the distributions of kids who drink and kids who don’t drink in terms of the test parameter, days at the playground.  Test: Ascertain from parents (kids) if their kids spend ≥ 3 days at the park or < 3 days at the park. If ≥ 3 days, call them drinkers If < 3 days, call them non-drinkers 2 pts Goal of test is to detect drinkers, i.e., a positive test is calling a kid a drinker (whether they actually do or not) Based on the distributions:         Therefore:  Sensitivity = TP/(TP + FN) x 100% = 80% Specificity = TN/(TN + FP) x 100% = 80% PPV           = TP/(TP + FP) x 100% = 80% NPV          = TN/(TN + FN) x 100% = 80% 1 pt;

Answer: 2pts Values for the populations of cities in the table were required to complete this problem.  A few minutes of creative web-searching with terms like 122 U.S. cities, CDC, populations, U.S. census, should have yielded websites with the needed information.  Here are two examples:  http://www.census.gov/population/estimates/metro-city/SC100K-T
8)  Is there anything going on in NYC regarding the risk of dying?  Answer: 1pt Insight: Risk assessment requires an “incidence” evaluation.  For deaths that is mortality rate. Use your population data to estimate the distribution mortality rate (“deaths in one week per persons”) and evaluate  whether  NYC’s  rate  (259  per  1000K)  is  significantly  different  by  either  CI  interval  analyses  or standard value analysis.

1. A single molecule may be sufficient to initiate an irreversible effect. 
2. Chemicals produce tumors similar to those that arise spontaneously, so  there is not a novel mechanism which would be associated with a threshold. 
3. Experiments with radiation have not revealed a statistically reliable  threshold. 
4. It is impossible to demonstrate a no-effect level in small groups of  animals that would be statistically valid for a billion humans. 
5. How do you determine the threshold? 
6. How do you account for the diversity of the human population? 
7. It is prudent to assume the worst case in pursuit of a public policy  toward cancer risk from chemicals.  Arguments against a linear non-threshold model:  
1) comparative analysis of human health indexes; 
2) calculation of cancer risk from soil contamination with PCBs.  The first part is further divided into a statistical analysis of morbidity data, and a special cohort research with two groups of school children. In order to compare the morbidity amongst the different areas of the city, a special data set was created where different areas of the city, regarded as observations, were characterized by 10 parameters on 10 classes of the diseases regarded as variables.  This allowed for easy comparison across the 5 districts and also for different diseases.   The researchers rightly pointed out that to make a valid comparative analysis using the morbidity data, there are two factors whose influence has to be taken into account: dynamics of morbidity parameters over time, and compatibility of the data from the different clinics.  The first issue is addressed through a significance test with a one-factor analysis of variance of disease level(discussed below).  The problem of compatibility can be expected to exist in practice, and as swn by Andrews et al.(
3.  However, they did not include errors for this number, so does that mean this range is a 95% confidence interval? This is unclear.  However, this assumption may be justified, since the calculated PCB concentration is “more or less commensurate with the real data from vegetable sampling” according to the author.   Another assumption that was made in their calculations is that the people living in private houses and/or having vegetable gardens in the Clinic 2 area consume about 75% of daily diet products grown on contaminated lands.  The range of daily consumption of PCB for the group is thus calculated from the above data.  Similarly, the possible daily consumption of PCB for the population living in ‘the most ecologically favorable’ area served by clinic 1 was also calculated.  The above calculations are reasonably followed although some errors are missing; however, it may be too difficult to provide such errors since they may be rough estimates and how they obtained them are unknown. The cancer risk from PCBs exposure has been calculated using the average mass of an individual as 65 kg nad the average life span as 70 years.  However, it was not clear how these were used in the calculations and how variance in the many parameters were taken care of.  True, as Fisher said, randomizing in the populations will take care of a lot of these problems, but there is inherent bias that is not taken care of.  People living in different areas are likely to have different socio-economic statuses that are confounding factors.  This problem of bias is inherent in the entire study, although the investigators have already tried their best to minimize them.  On a side note, it may help if the authors also calculated attributable risk of cancer, to present a clearer picture with this statistic. The results are that cancer cases per 1000,000 persons per year in clinic 2 shows more than a 100 percent excess when compared to the other 4 clinics.  It is hypothesized that the excess is at least in large part due to exposure to PCBs.  The effect of continued exposure through consumption of locally grown food is much smaller.  Note that it is still not possible to 100% establish exposure to PCB as THE cause for cancer/diseases since such statistical tests cannot prove an hypothesis in such a way.  However, this does add substantially to evidence of a correlation between exposure to PCBs and diseases. In conclusion, the study was well thought-out and used many statistical tools appropriately.  The comparative study allowed for a quantitative comparison of risk by high levels of exposure to PCBs.  Comparison of morbidity between two groups of schoolchildren served by clinic 2 but with difference in residence in high or low PCB contaminated areas further factored out differences in clinics and in the overall area attributes such that overall social and residential conditions in the two groups are more similar(although power is decreased by decrease in sample size).  Thus differences in morbidity may be attributed to the differences in exposure to PCBs.  Cancer was also found to be in excess in the area served by clinic 2 by calculating the PCB dose exposure average for each area and the individual risk and prevalence of the disease for each population.  This also indicated a significant increase in cancer rate.  Thus, the study is conclusive in adding evidence to the hypothesis of adverse health effects of environmental PCB exposure.

8. 20pts Further investigation reveals the contact lens wear does not account for the incidence in eye irritation.  Your investigation reveals that there may be an unknown agent released in the Infinite Corridor that is responsible for the increase incidence of eye irritation.

Poisson.  Low  numbers  of  crossings  that  are  random  in  occurrence,  likely  to  be independent, and unlikely to significantly affect the population of potential crossers.     5pts: If you observe that the mean of distribution #2, described above, is 2, what is the likelihood that 5 people will cross the midway point of the Infinite Corridor during 5-minute intervals between 2 AM and 5 AM on an average academic-year day?

Lateral gene transfer (LGT) can be divided in four main steps:  release of genetic information from a donor, targeting of genetic information to a recipient, uptake, and successful incorporation of the genetic information by the recipient.

1. 3 Part III.  Creating classes and using objects  (60 points) Introduction to classes and objects (from java.sun.com/docs/books/tutorial/java/): In the real world, you often have many objects of the same kind.  For example, your bicycle is just one of many bicycles in the world.  Using object-oriented terminology, we say that your bicycle object is an instance of the class of objects known as bicycles.  Bicycles have some state (current gear, current cadence, two wheels) and behavior (change gears, brake) in common.  However, each bicycle's state is independent of and can be different from that of other bicycles.  When building them, manufacturers take advantage of the fact that bicycles share characteristics, building many bicycles from the same blueprint.  It would be very inefficient to produce a new blueprint for every bicycle manufactured.  In object-oriented software, it is also possible to have many objects of the same kind that share characteristics.  Like bicycle manufacturers, you can take advantage of the fact that objects of the same kind are similar and you can create a blueprint for those objects.  A software blueprint for objects is called a class. The class for our bicycle example would declare the instance variables necessary to contain the current gear, the current cadence, and so on for each bicycle object.  The class would also declare and provide implementations for the instance methods that allow the rider to change gears, brake, and change the pedaling cadence.  After you've created the bicycle class, you can create any number of bicycle objects from that class.  When you create an instance of a class, the system allocates enough memory for the object and all its instance variables.  Each instance gets its own copy of all the instance variables defined in the class.  Objects provide the benefit of modularity and information-hiding.  Classes provide the benefit of reusability.  Bicycle manufacturers use the same blueprint over and over again to build lots of bicycles.  Software programmers use the same class, and thus the same code, over and over again to create many objects. A.  In this section, you will use some of your code from Part I to create a class and construct inverter objects.  To create the class Inverter, insert this code at the top of your Python script: class Inverter: def __init__(self, thisRBS, thisORF, thisTerminator, thisPromoter):self.RBS=thisRBS self.ORF=thisORF self.terminator=thisTerminator self.promoter=thisPromoter def getORFLength(self):return len(self.ORF[1]) 4 The __init__ function is the constructor function for the class Inverter, and is called whenever a new object is created.  To create each new Inverter object, you will need to specify the appropriate arguments, which will be fed into the constructor.  Note that the constructor that we defined above takes in five arguments.  The first argument, self, automatically references the object you are currently working with; therefore, you only need to pass in the other four arguments when creating a new object.  self refers to a specific object, so self.foo  accesses foo, which can be a variable or function associated with that object.  For example, the function getORFLength in class Inverter returns the length of the DNA sequence of the ORF that is associated with a specific Inverter object (self.ORF[1] is used to access the second item in the two-item self.ORF list, defined below). Now, as you did in Part I.C, you should write a loop to construct all possible valid inverters using myDict. Here, instead of saving each one to a dictionary, create a new Inverter object for each new valid inverter as follows: newInverter=Inverter(RBSInfo, ORFInfo, terminatorInfo, promoterInfo).  partInfo should be a two-item list, where the first item is the Part’s name (e.g. B

2.  Once you have gone through each mer in merListRec, you will need to pick out the best mer(s).  The set of best mers (will use the plural, but there may be only one) is the set of mers with the lowest worst score.  Store this score in the variable bestScore, and the list of all mers with this score in the list listOfBestMers.  For example, the mer “TT” gives scores [0, 1, 1, 1] for the genome “AGTCT”.  The worst score for this mer would be 
1. I don't know if I'm interpreting them wrong, but why does it seem like the rules don't cover all possible cases? Such as for arginine, which can only be A/C in the first position, and serine, which can only be C/G in the second position. Are we supposed to assign these nucleotides with H and N respectively, even if substituting U in arginine and A/U in serine will result in a different amino acid codon?"  o  Yes, there was an oversight in the rule-making. However, please still follow the rules outlined in the pdf for the purposes of this assignment. We will not test your code with a protein containing arginine or serine.

1.  The 'initTree(tree,alignment)' function takes care of adding these data to our leaf nodes.  You will write a function called 'downPass(tree)' which adds sequence data to internal nodes and keeps track of how many mutations (mismatches) are necessary to explain the oserved data. The DownPass algorithm.  The logic behind the 'downpass' is simple: if two daughter nodes share the same nucleotide at a given position, then the last common ancestor (LCA) also probably has the same nucleotide.  Alternatively, if the two daughter nodes have different characters, then the LCA probably shares a common character with one (but not both) of the daughters. If the two daughter nodes are also internal nodes, then each may have more than one possible character at each position of the alignment.  In this case we can generalize the above logic using 'intersection' and 'union' operators.  The pseudocode for this general algorithm is given below: def downPass(tree):#this function returns the number of mutations necessary#to explain the sequence data, given the tree topology#and assigns sequences to the internal nodes if tree is a leaf: #no need to assign sequence, its already there return 0 #no mutations necessary leftCost = downPass(left child) rightCost = downPass(right child) foreach character in sequence: if intersection(left child, right child) not empty:1 of 2 9/19/06 5:35 PM http://www.writely.com/RawDocContents.aspx?docID=dggds9kn_

1. Accompanying this assignment is some python code that implements an incomplete  version of Mike Gibson’s “Next Reaction Method” for computing the exact behavior of discrete chemical systems (nextrxn.py).  To complete the program you’ll need to add a small bit of code that computes the updated time for reactions whose substrate abundances change in response to the execution of another reaction.  The needed formula is: t_new = (a_old/a_new)*(t_old-t_current)+t_current where, t_new is the updated reaction time,t_old is the old reaction timea_old is the old reaction propensity,a_new is the new reaction propensity, and t_current is the current system time.(Note: Variable names provided above are not the *exact* ones used in the code.)

2. Take a look at the two input files (switch.rxns and switch.spcs); these files define a simple bistable switch device [a switch is a device that stores information in one of two (or more) states].

You’ll need to use a system volume of 1E-15L. Parts

4.  You need to model a many-reaction chemical system in which the execu-tion of any one reaction impacts the substrate abundances for all other reactions in thesystem. The system is fully coupled, so there would be no expected acceleration via Gib-son’s method.  In fact, Gibson’s method may actually be more expensive relativeto Gillespie’s original methods.  Go with option 2 (Direct method). 3
1.  Figure  1  shows  a  resistor  network  known  as  a  Wheatstone  Bridge,  which  will  be  part  of apparatus that you’ll build shortly for the DNA melting curves module.  You can read a bit more about it in the handout for that module.  For now, we will look at it analytically.  Rx  is a resistance you are trying to measure, and R3  is a variable resistor. Figure 1:  A Wheatstone bridge circuit. (a)  Assuming R3  is set such that the bridge is balanced (i.e.  Vab  = 
2.  Referring  again  to  the  Wheatstone  Bridge  in  Figure  1,  suppose  that  Rx  varies  with  some physical parameter (strain, temperature, etc.)  in the range of 1-10kΩ.  You want to use the circuit to measure the physical variable by observing Vab  and correlating it to the resistance changes.  In what range should the values of R1, R2  and R3  be to make a sensitive measure­ment?  Explain your reasoning.  (Hint:  using matlab to plot the output as a function of the varying resistances is a very useful way to think about this problem).

(b)  Since  this  is  such  a  high-gain  circuit,  it  can  be  quite  noisy,  if  the  input  current	 Iin experiences  high-frequency  ﬂuctuations.  You  can  insert  a  capacitor  across  one  of  the resistors  to  reduce  the  noise  (i.e.  make  a  low-pass  ﬁlter  to  eliminate  high-frequency content).  Where would you insert it, and how would you choose its size? (c)  Now write down the expression for this new circuit’s output with respect to the current input  for  AC  signals  (Hint:  in  the  expression  from  part  (a),  substitute  the  parallel combination Rx � C  for the resistor Rx  that you chose). 2
1.  Use matlab to generate a time vector y(t), approximately one second long, with a sampling frequency  fsamp  of  a  few  kHz  (the  syntax  “vector=start  value:increment:end  value;” will be useful here — increment is the time between your samples or 1/fsamp). Then create a sinusoid based on that time vector — choose a frequency fSIN  of a few hundred Hz: y = sin(ωSIN t) = sin(2πfSIN t) Calculate  the  PSD  of  your  sinusoid  using  the  pwelch  1  command,  and  plot  it  on  a  linear scale and a logarithmic scale; use the plot and loglog commands, respectively.  What is the signiﬁcance of the highest and lowest frequencies that appear on the plot? 
2.  An important feature of pwelch is that it always correctly normalizes the total power of the PSD,  but—depending  on  the  parameters  you  use—you  can  get  quite  diﬀerent  PSD  shapes for the same signal.  For example, the default parameters give a lot of spectral leakage.  To see a low-leakage spectrum, try running pwelch with the nfft and window parameters satisfying the following conditions: - the sinusoid frequency fSIN  is an integer multiple of the quantity fsamp/Nf f t- window is the same length as nfft.Can you suggest what causes spectral leakage?  Plot the low-leakage PSD on the same axes as your previous linear and log plots (use hold after plotting one waveform to freeze a ﬁgure, before plotting a second).  Considering the relative magnitudes,  how much does the leakage matter? 
3.  Recall that one of the consequences of Parseval’s theorem is the following relationship between a time-domain signal f(x) and its PSD F (ω): �� �  ∞ 0 f(x)2= F (ω)dω. Verify that this is the case for the sine wave you’ve been using by computing its mean-square value  in  the  time  domain,  and  the  integral  of  its  PSD  in  the  frequency  domain  (matlab’s var and sum functions will be useful here).  Remember that you’re eﬀectively calculating an area, and make sure that units match up:  pwelch gives you the PSD in units2/Hz, while the integral of your PSD needs to be equal to a mean-square value (units

Migrating cells often have the appearance shown in the figure below, with actively extending, finger-like protrusions (filopodia) in the front that push through the matrix material,  and long tube-like tethers in the rear where the cell adheres to the matrix, that eventually must be released if the cell is to  make forward progress.  This problem considers both the forward protrusions and the  tethers at the rear.   In a set of in vitro  a)  experiments designed to determine the force with which the cell pushes forward into the matrix (see Legant, et al., Nature Materia/s, 2010, see figure), the cell is induced to migrate through a gel with a known elastic or Young's  modulus,  E.  In order to  estimate the force, small marker beads are seeded into the gel and their displacement is observed during cell migration.  (These beads can be assumed to be rigidly fixed to the gel, but have no  effect on the gel's elastic properties.) As the cell sends a protrusion forward,  the beads just in front of the leading edge are observed to move a distance δ.  Given that the protrusion can be pictured as a "finger" of radius a,  and the deformations are observed to extend into the gel  a distance that scales with a, estimate the force with which the protruding "finger" pushes against the gel.    b) 	  At the trailing tether, the gel is assumed  to pull backward  with a point force F  as shown in the magnified view and in the cross-sectional view,  A­A.  If the tether is viewed  as a cylinder with radius R, use a force balance to  determine the tension  N in the membrane that comprises the tether.  c) 	 In the vicinity of the externally acting force at the end  of the tether, the membrane shape is determined by a combination of  membrane tension and bending.  What relationship must be satisfied if  bending and tension effects are approximately in balance?  Use this expression in  combination with your answer in (b) to obtain an estimate for the radius of the tether, R.  8d) 	  Fragments of membrane that have been torn away from  the cell are often observed attached to the matrix behind the cell.

2. (34 pts) Expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE) is a commonly used material for synthetic vascular grafts.  One mode of failure of such devices is via bacterial infection initiated during implantation. Upon the introduction of a foreign material into the body, a competition for the surface ensues between bacteria and leukocytes that serve to fight infection.  One hypothesis for elevated infection rates for PTFE graft implantations is that leukocyte migration is impeded on ePTFE surfaces, allowing bacteria to become established in the early stages following implantation.

1. (38 pts) Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, ALS, also known as Lou Gherig’s disease, is a neuromuscular disorder in which patients gradually lose peripheral motor activity.  One approach under investigation for treatment of ALS combines gene therapy with cell encapsulation therapy.  In the ALS treatment under consideration, rodent cell lines are modified genetically to release ciliary derived neurotrophic factor, CNTF, an agent which has shown promise for slowing the deterioration of neurons in more conventional preclinical drug tests.  In conventional cell culture studies, Hamster-BHK cells transfected with the gene for CNTF, showed promisingly high secretion rates of 1 ng/106cells/day.   You are working for a company that is developing a cell encapsulation device to house the Hamster-BHK cells in vivo.  Prototype membranes having the porosity characteristics given in the table below have been developed. (a) What functions does the membrane serve in this device?  (3 pts) The membrane serves to contain the cells as well as isolate them from the immune system while still allowing for permeability of nutrients, waste and CNTF. (b) What processing route would be used to make the membrane for this device? What would be a typical material for such a membrane? (4 pts) A membrane could be formed using immersion precipitation of PAN-PVC, PP, polycarbonate, cellulose nitrate, or acrylic polymers.  In this process, a polymer solution is coated onto a cylindrical substrate and the substrate is dipped into a coagulation bath that contains a poor solvent for the polymer.  The polymer precipitates onto the substrate and subsequent removal of the substrate leaves a hollow fiber membrane.

2. (34 pts) Expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE) is a commonly used material for synthetic vascular grafts.  One mode of failure of such devices is via bacterial infection initiated during implantation. Upon the introduction of a foreign material into the body, a competition for the surface ensues between bacteria and leukocytes that serve to fight infection.  One hypothesis for elevated infection rates for PTFE graft implantations is that leukocyte migration is impeded on ePTFE surfaces, allowing bacteria to become established in the early stages following implantation.   (a) Describe the process by which leukocytes are attracted and migrate to the site of a vascular graft implantation. (4 pts) Complement activation by the alternative pathway occurs when activation of endothelial cells at the site of injury results in cleavage of C3 protein and the deposition of C3b on the graft surface.  The C3b fragment catalyzes the cleavage of C5 to C5a, which is a soluble ligand for specific receptors expressed on the leukocyte cell surface. This recognition of C5a allows for chemotactic attraction and migration of leukocytes to the site of implantation.  4

1.  What is the structure of water in different temperatures?  A single water molecule forms a tetrahedron, where the two hydrogen atoms and lone pairs sit at the corners, and the single oxygen molecule forms the center. These lone pairs act as Hydrogen (H) acceptors during H-bonding with neighboring water molecules, and the H atoms are of course donors. Each molecule is therefore both a donor and an acceptor, allowing clusters (and rings) to form due to the tetrahedral shape.  Figure 1 depicts how a single tetrahedral water molecule can H-bond to four other molecules, setting a definitive angle between neighboring molecules, as well as bond distance (depending on temperature).  In general, liquid water is arranged into small groups of joined clusters. Since these groups are small, water is able to move and flow. Frozen water, on the other hand, has a highly structured geometric pattern. Water at high temperatures in the form of gas is highly charged with energy, causing molecules to be in constant motion, thereby reducing the likelihood of bond formation between molecules.  Water does not conform to a single structure at select temperatures due to the dynamic nature imposed by complex hydrogen bonding. The three dimensional H-bond network can undergo many configurations. Even at constant temperature of 230K (-
2. Please draw the structures of 20 L-amino acids and 4 nucleotides. Write their full names, three-letter code and one letter code. Please arrange amino acids in the order of hydrophobic, hydrophilic, polar and nonpolar groups. Explain briefly their side chain’s tendency to interact with water. Please draw all possible hydrogen bonds on the side chains of amino acids and explain how they interact with water. Draw all possible hydrogen bonds for the nucleic acid bases (follow the books).  Hydrophobic and Non-polar I’ve listed these in order of increasing hydrophobicity according to the “Hydropathy index” which measures the tendency of an amino acid to seek an aqueous environment.  Negative values are more hydrophilic, positive values are hydrophobic.  In looking at different websites, and over four textbooks, there has been some discrepancy about some of the amino acids classification, so for this question I’ve used this more quantitative approach.3 The H-bonds drawn indicate the interaction with water. In general, a lot of H-bonding with water results in being hydrophilic.  Glycine Gly (G) -.4  Not hydrophobic per se (negative index) but considered non-polar Methionine Met (M) 
3. Describe in detail the basic characteristics of several secondary structural construction motifs and explain their functions in determining the structures of protein and protein-materials. The α-helix and β-sheet are secondary structural motifs “designed” by nature to be used mainly in the hydrophobic core of protein structures. By optimizing hydrogen bonding between N-H and C=O regions of different amino acids, these very polar regions are neutralized, making it possible for the polar backbone to exist in the hydrophobic core. a) Alpha-helix   Intra-chain hydrogen bonding is utilized to orient the polar chemical groups (C=O and N-H) that are part of the peptide bond. Every peptide bond (except those at the ends, which are polar and therefore almost always at the surface) participates in H-bonding, which is why the structure is so stable. Each successive turn binds to adjacent turns using three or four H-bonds. The cyclical pattern is such that the C’=O of residue n acts as the H-acceptor from N-H of residue n+4 (figure

5) The charge of residues at the ends of the helices can affect the net dipole. Synthetic peptides (ie DAR) where the charges of side chains at the ends oppose the net dipole (put neg charged D at + charged N terminus, and pos charged R at –charged C terminus) result in extremely stable α-helices.   Although they are rare, other helices are possible by modifying the H-bond pattern as described for α-helices.  b) 3-10 helix. This secondary structure is less common than the α-helix, but can sometimes be found at the end of an α-helix. Unlike the n, n+4 hydrogen bonding pattern observed in α-helices, 3-10 helices display a pattern where the backbone C=O residue n H-bonds to the HN of residue n+
6. Explain the significance of the high-resolution crystal structure of collagen. What have you learned from the single crystal structure? Explain why glycines and prolines are important in forming the structure of collagen?  Since Pro is by nature bent, Pro and Pro-OH efficiently bend the chain back around the helix and provide elasticity and strength due to the limited conformations it can assume. In the ER, Prolines are hydroxylated post-translationally to form the more stable hydroxyproline by prolyl hydroxylase. Prolines are also sometimes glycosylated to increase hydration properties, since it is very important to retain water in collagen.  Another important finding of the crystal structure was the formation of inter-chain H-bonds between the C=O of Pro/Pro-OH and H-N of Gly, keeping the helices together. Unlike the α-helix and β-sheet, the collagen helix does not involve every single main chain C=O and N-H group in intra-molecular H-bonding. Collagen triple helices have only one such direct bond per tri-peptide repeat. The high-resolution structure has demonstrated the importance of both intra-molecular and inter-molecular bonds with water in keeping the structure stable. Triple helices are surrounded by a structured cylindrical hydration shell that becomes important in determining lateral separation in macromolecular fibril assemblies described later. Alpha water bridges form intra-molecularly within the backbone whereas β water bridges form inter-molecularly among backbones. Long inter-chain bridges form a network surrounding the triple helix. The OH groups on Pro-OH are also important for water-mediated H-bonding. Gamma bridges form between Pro-OH’s –OH group with one backbone intra-molecularly, and delta bridges occur inter-molecularly between the three strands.  The bond distances for the collagen fragment formed with a Gly(cid:
7. Describe the molecular structures of silkworm silk and the spider silk. Both proteins have a high content of glycine. How are these glycines arranged in both silkworm silk and spider silk structures?   Fig.11 Figure removedfor copyright reasons.The protein that makes up silk is called fibroin, and is produced by spiders and silkworms. Fibroin is rich in Ala and Gly residues, which forms β- sheets that pack closely with interlocking R groups. In Fibroin, β-sheets are oriented anti-parallel, and the small side chains interdigitate to allow very close packing for each layered sheet. As discussed with beta sheets, structure is stabilized by hydrogen bonding between all peptide linkages in each β-sheet as well as van der waals interactions for stacked sheets due to the predominance of small side chains such as Gly, Ala, and Ser.6 Figure 11 shows the stacking of β-sheets in silk fibroin. Notice the R-groups between sheets; there are alternating layers of Ala and Gly. Silkworm silk: Fibroin is bundled and arranged lengthwise to form a continuous fiber that can be very long made my silk worms.  Fibroins overlap to form fibers as long as 2km! Fibroin from silkworm cocoons has two subunits held together covalently via disulfide bonds: Fibroin Heavy Chain (~350kDa) and Fibroin Light Chain(~25kDa). The structure of the heavy chain is composed of long fiber domains made up of repeats of the amino acid sequence 7(-GSGAGA-)Nis replaced by Tyr. Note, however, that both Ser and Tyr contain –OH groups and can form 3 hydrogen bonds.  . These stretches are interrupted by short bulkier stretches in which the Ser More than 80% of silkworm silk forms β-sheets, as one would expect from alternating Ala and Gly residues. These β-sheets are oriented anti-parallel, and the small side chains interdigitate to allow very close packing for each layered sheet.  Ala residues stagger on one side, and Gly on the other. Hydrophobic interactions occur between Ala (or Ser) residues between stacked sheets. It is not surprising to find such as high proportion of Gly residues because it is so flexible.  As with spider silk described later, some silk worms also make β-sheets entirely from poly-alanine repeat sequences. Looking at the primary sequence of the heavy chain from B.mori silk, one can see there is a pattern of hydrophobic and hydrophilic blocks.  There are large hyrdophilic blocks at the chain ends and six smaller hydrophilic internal blocks separating seven internal hydrophobic blocks. In water, these form micelle structures and fibroin globules upon higher concentration. Low concentrations of fibroin result in “random coils,” high concentrations of fibroin without physical shear result in silk I, and physical shear or exposure to solvents like methanol result in silk II. Silk II is in the β form, which is composed of the described antiparallel β pleated sheets.  In silk II, the peptide chains run parallel to the fiber axis. Sericin family proteins are utilized as glue to hold fibers together, and are hydrophilic. 7  Spider silk: Spider silk contains both α-helices and β-sheets (but no sericin glue), which function as a block co polymer. The β-sheets form crystalline packing that provide strength, and the α-and extendibility. There are many types of spider silk (draglincapture, frame, etc), and each contains a different proportionα-helices, 3-10 helices, and β-sheets, resulting in different strength, flexibility, and extendibility.8   e,  of ndergo different gene expression for the Spiders ut types of silk modules they make. Crystalline β-shdiffereneets (and weakly oriented sheets) exist in an amorphous glycine-richmatrix in dragline silk, which is organized as in figure 
8. Briefly explain X-ray crystallography used in determination of the molecular structure of biological materials.   Although useful for many biological application, like visualizing a whole cell, light microscopes cannot discriminate structures at an atomic scale. In accordance with Bragg’s law, in order to see an object, its size has to be at least half the wavelength of the light being used to see it. When any electromagnetic wave hits an atom, they make the electron cloud move around it. Rayleigh scattering occurs when waves re-radiate with the same frequency. The diffraction phenomenon is when these re-emitted rays interfere, giving constructive or destructive interference. 9 The smaller the wavelength, the smaller objects you can resolve.  The wavelength of visible light (400-700nm), though small, is much bigger than an atom, making it invisible. X-rays, however, have a wavelength (.07-.15nm) short enough to resolve atoms of a protein crystal.  The setup for X-ray crystallography is different than light microscopy in that there is no x-ray lens. Scattering from a single molecule is so weak that crystals must be used to amplify the signal by creating aligned arrays of molecules that scatter rays at the same angles.  Atoms in the protein crystal scatter the x-rays from a narrow beam, which produce a diffraction pattern of discrete spots with different intensities when captured on x-ray film or a solid-state electronic detector. Each atom in the protein molecule makes a contribution to the intensity and location of each spot.  Since there is no lens to recombine x-rays to form an image, the diffraction pattern must be reconstructed mathematically using the Fourier transform.  Since each spot is the result of interference of all x-rays with the same angle emerging from all atoms, it is difficult to extract information on individual atoms. One needs to account for the interference, positive or negative, with other emerging beams- this is the phase problem. One way to solve this problem is to compare data from native crystals with those containing heavy atoms like selenium.  The number of electrons in the atom determines the intensity of its scattering of x-rays, and the amplitude of the spot is easy to determine.  Heavier atoms scatter more effectively, so scientists diffuse different heavy metal complexes into the channels of pre-formed crystals, and compare data from those crystals without metal.  This phase determination method is called “Multiple isomorphous replacement.”  Another similar method is the “Multiwavelength Anomalous Diffraction” method. Sometimes electrons absorb some of the energy from the x-rays, changing the scattering. This effect depends on the wavelength of the x-rays and type of atom. One can infuse a protein with seleno-methionine using recombinant technology, and take diffraction measurements using different wavelengths to solve the phase problem. Other methods of phase determination include “Molecular Replacement” where the structure of a known protein is used to initially phase the data, and “Direct Methods” which are computationally expensive and involve the fact that certain intensities can be generated by particular combinations of phases. The quality of your crystal (degree of structural order) greatly determines the amount of information you can learn.  Many proteins are very difficult to crystallize, and poor crystals result in errors and incorrect structures.   Proteins are globular, large, spherical, ellipsoidal objects with irregular surfaces that can be difficult to pack into ordered arrays.  In reporting X-ray crystallography data, one must report the “R-factor”: a measure for the deviations between the observed and calculated amplitudes of structure factors. A value of .4 is usually a starting point, .2 is acceptable, and .1 is usually required for publications.   It is important to realize that looking at a crystal structure does not necessarily tell you about the protein in its native state. Upon crystallization, a protein is frozen in time, and so the image cannot tell you about rearrangements and transformations that happen within a cell. NMR described later is more useful for this kind of information.  X-ray diffraction, however, is more useful for proteins too large to be analyzed by NMR.  Briefly explain both solution and solid state NMR in determination of the molecular structure of biological materials. Solution State NMR:  An advantage Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) has over X-ray crystallography is that samples do not have to be crystallized. NMR can be used to deduce information about protein dynamics such as folding, conformational changes, and interactions with other molecules. One disadvantage, however, is that molecules must be small (<200aa).  NMR is a phenomenon which occurs when the nuclei of certain atoms are immersed in a static magnetic field and exposed to a second oscillating magnetic field. Some nuclei experience this phenomenon, and others do not, dependent upon whether they possess a magnetic moment, or “spin”. Most elements do have an isotope available that is detectible by NMR.  An atomic nuclei’s nuclear spin causes its magnetic dipole to line up with respect to a strong external magnetic field. This equilibrium alignment can occur in parallel (low energy) or anti-parallel (high energy). To change alignment to an excited state, a short pulse (~10us) of electromagnetic energy of a suitable frequency (the Resonant Frequencey, RF) is applied at right angles to the nuclei aligned in the magnetic field. The use of pulses of different shapes, frequencies, and durations, in specifically-designed patterns or “pulse sequences” allows the spectroscopist to extract many different types of information about the molecule. As the nuclei revert to their equilibrium alignment, they emit measurable RF radiation as a decaying sinusoid signal.  Each atom has a different molecular environment, and emits a different radiation frequency (unless they are chemically equivalent).  The electron density around each nucleus in a molecule varies according to the types of nuclei and bonds in the molecule. The opposing field and therefore the effective field at each nucleus will vary. This is called the chemical shift phenomenon.  Chemical shift are taken in respect to a reference signal.  Recording the chemical shifts from 1H atoms give you a one-dimensional spectrum.  These can be very difficult to interpret because there are hundreds of 1H atoms even in small proteins.  Extra information can be obtained by adding more spectral dimensions. A two-dimensional NMR experiment involves a series of one-dimensional experiments. Each experiment consists of a sequence of radio frequency pulses with delay periods in between them. It is the timing, frequencies, and intensities of these pulses that distinguish different NMR experiments from one another. During some of the delays, the nuclear spins are allowed to freely rotate for a determined length of time known as the “evolution time”. The frequencies of the nuclei are detected after the final pulse. By incrementing the evolution time in successive experiments, a two-dimensional data set is generated from a series of one-dimensional experiments. Peaks on the diagonal in the plots from such experiments correspond to normal 1D NMR.  Interactions between nearby hydrogen atoms create peaks off the diagonal.  One can use magnetization transferred by scalar coupling (J-coupling) in COSY (Correlation spectroscopy) experiments. Protons that are more than three chemical bonds apart give no cross signal (coupling constants are close to

By creating an interface between materials derived from an organism (proteins) and inorganic materials found in the environment (CaCO3, SiO2, Fe3O4, hydroxyapatite), nature has effortlessly fashioned a foundation for building high-performance nanocomposite materials.

5.  Transport by diffusion tends to move solutes from regions of high concentration to regions of low concentration, thereby making the spatial distribution of solute more uniform. Thus diffusion is often associated with mixing. However, diffusion can also be used to separate solutes in a mixture. Such separation is important as a mechanism to purify mixtures of biological materials (such as mixtures of DNA fragments) and is currently being exploited in microfabricated systems for biological and medical analysis (which we will look at in greater detail in the Microﬂuidics Laboratory Project).

Explain how this viscometer can be used to construct the stress-strain relationship of a non-Newtonian ﬂuid like blood, when the torque T  on the cone and the angular speed ω  are known. Figure 1: Tω R r z In order to construct a ﬂow curve for the unknown ﬂuid we must measure both the shear rate and the shear stress of the ﬂuid.  We are given the cone viscometer with angular velocity ω  and torque T . The cone angle, θ, is very small, so we make the following approximations: tan θ  ≈  sin θ  ≈  θ ; cos θ  ≈  1; R cos θ  ≈  R The angular velocity ω  should tell us about shear rate.  Let us consider a band of ﬂuid at a distance r from the center that is dr wide and h high. (See Figure

In order to perform this alignment, you must first choose a scoring matrix.  For example, you could use a constant match and mismatch penalty of 1 and -1, respectively, so that −1 otherwise.  Is this a good idea? Why or why not? In one sentence, S!"=1 if i = j and S!"=briefly describe how you might obtain a better scoring matrix for protein comparison.  No - not all amino acid substitutions are equally (dis)favored. Some changes will more heavily impact protein structure and function than others, and will therefore evolve less frequently, and so they should be scored differently.  For example, changing from one medium-sized hydrophobic residue to another (e.g., Val to Ile or Leu) within a signal peptide or transmembrane helix is often tolerated, but changing a hydrophobic to a charged residue could disrupt function in these contexts, and changing a buried medium-sized hydrophobic residue like Val to a much larger residue (e.g., Trp) could disrupt packing. Instead, commonly used scoring matrices are created by comparing related protein sequences and seeing how often evolution has allowed particular substitutions occur - these matrices better capture proteins’ functional constraints than this simple +1/-1 scoring scheme.   (B) (1 pt.) You decide to explore more commonly used protein alignment scoring matrices instead. Compare the score for aligning two tryptophans (W) to the score for aligning two alanines (A) in the PAM250 scoring matrix.  Both of these alignments are “matches”, so why are these scores so different?  W-W pairings have a large positive score, while A-A pairings have a small positive score.  This means that tryptophan residues are generally highly conserved, and changes from tryptophan to another amino acid are rare (and therefore generally evolutionarily unfavorable).  Conversely, alanine is not as strongly conserved and changes relatively frequently.  From a biochemical perspective, this makes sense since alanine is very small and won’t generally have a big impact on protein structure (and is similar to many other nonpolar amino acids), while tryptophan is very big and changing it to almost anything else could dramatically alter protein structure.        5(C) (2 pts.)

However, we are applying this continuous distribution to a scoring system that only takes on discrete values, so the P(S = x) values in our scoring system have nonzero mass (a reasonable value for P(S = x) would be CDF(x+

6. Modeling and information content of sequence motifs (5 points). To analyze gene evolution in three phylogenetic groups of protists, you collect samples of three different protist species, A, B, and C, that represent these lineages. You conduct both genome sequencing and cDNA sequencing from each and use spliced alignment of cDNAs to genomes to obtain sets of 10,000 confirmed 3' splice site (3'SS) sequences from each species.  In all three species the invariant AG at the end of each intron is preceded by an 8 base polypyrimidine tract (PPT), with frequencies fC = fT = 1 at each position.  Your goal is to develop probabilistic models of the PPT motif in each species for use in exon-intron prediction.  Throughout this problem, unless instructed otherwise, you should describe the simplest possible model (fewest parameters) that accurately models the frequencies of all 8mers in the training data (and should therefore give good predictive accuracy). Information content of models should be calculated using the formula given in lecture: I = 2w – H(model), in bits, where w is the width of the motif and H(model) is the Shannon entropy of the model. The abbreviation Y8 refers to 8mers that consist exclusively of pyrimidine (C or T) nucleotides. 2 (A) (1 pt.)

1. Aligning reads to a genome using a Burrows Wheeler Transform and FM Index (9 points) For this exercise you will be implementing the core of a genome search function utilizing the Burrows Wheeler transform (BWT) and an FM-index.  We have provided scaffolding code so that you can focus on the core of the algorithm.   Please do not use Internet search tools to try to solve this problem – the point is for you to understand how the algorithm works. You will need the coding and testing files from the course website (keep them in the same folder). This includes scaffold code, a 10kb segment of the yeast genome, reads which you will map to the genome, and an index for testing with correct output. (A)  (7 pt.) Complete the LF mapping code in the _lf(self, idx, qc) function and the search code in the bounds(self, q) function (both in fmindex.py). To test your implementations we have provided the FM-index of an abbreviated version of the yeast genome in test.index. Running  % python fm-search.py test.index yeast_chr1_reads.txt out.txt will place the mapped reads in out.txt and test your implementation. The correct output of this command is given in test_mapped.txt for you to check the correctness of your implementation.  Your implementations of the _lf(self, idx, qc) and bounds(self, q) functions are the answer to

3. Differential gene expression (4 points) You are analyzing RNA-seq data to identify differentially expressed genes between two treatment conditions. You have three biological replicates in each of the two conditions for a total of 6 samples, and you process and sequence each of the samples separately. (A) (1 pts) Imagine you first pool the sequencing results for each of the conditions, resulting in two pools. What kind of variation have you lost the ability to observe, and why might this variation be important?  This is performing analysis without any replicates. If we observe a difference between the conditions, we are unable to know if this difference is due to differential expression between the different conditions or due to baseline variation between the replicates (just due to technical or biological variation).  5(B) (3 pts) Devise an improved analysis strategy for these six samples and identify the sources of variation it can detect. Identify how you would estimate the mean-dispersion function for use in a negative binomial model of variation. Don’t pool the sequencing results together. Now, since we have replicates for each condition, we can compute an empirical dispersion value per gene, rather than estimating dispersion from genes which have similar expression levels across conditions (under the assumption that the condition effect is minimal for these genes). This allows us to detect technical/biological variation among samples within the same condition as well as variation in excess of that due to differential expression between the two conditions. Problem 
4. RNA Isoform quantification (3 points)  Consider the gene structure in the above figure. Exon numbers and sizes in nucleotides are indicated. The transcript can initiate at either of the arrows shown, and exons 2 and/or 3 can be spliced out.  (A) (1 pt.) How many possible isoforms of this gene could exist? 6 isoforms (B) (1 pt.) For each isoform, list the junction spanning RNA-seq reads that would support Reads Only 1-4 spanning reads 1-2, and 2-4 spanning reads 1-3 and 3-4 spanning reads 1-2, 2-3, and 3-4 spanning reads Only 2-4 spanning reads 2-3 and 3-4 spanning reads it.  Isoform 1-4 1-2-4 1-3-4 1-2-3-4 2-4 2-3-4  6(C) (1 pt.) Assuming single ended reads, what is the shortest read length that would guarantee the ability to unambiguously identify all isoforms of this gene if we require that a junction read must have minimum overlap of 5bp with each exon?  260bp – the 150bp of exon 2, 100bp of exon 3, and 5bp overlap with exons 1 and 4 Problem 
5. de Bruijn graphs (5 points) Suppose you are interested in sequencing a particular RNA sequence. You opt to take a next generation sequencing approach and submit your sample to your local sequencing facility.

1. Gibbs Sampler (10 Points). You are studying longevity in two species, A and B.  A study was recently published showing that a transcription factor called AGE is involved in regulating many aging- and stress-related pathways in both species A and B.  AGE is known to affect transcription by binding to the promoters of its target genes.  You have a list of aging-related genes whose expression changed (as measured by RNA-seq) in age(-) mutants relative to wild-type in species A.  From a similar experiment, you obtained a list of genes whose expression changed in age(-) in species B.  You want to look at the promoters of these genes to see if you can find any enriched sequence motif that might be a recognition site for AGE.  You have two lists of sequences – seqsA.fa contains the 30bp upstream from the AGE target genes in A, and seqsB.fa contains 30bp upstream from the AGE target genes in B.  To do this analysis, you will implement a Gibbs sampler!  Once you are done modifying the script for parts A-D, please submit your completed gibbsSampler.py script to the Homework Submissions dropbox on the course website.

In the following, we will provide instructions on how to complete this problem on Athena’s Dialup Service, where PyRosetta has previously been installed as a module for another class – you may install PyRosetta (http://www.pyrosetta.org/dow) locally on your own computer and complete the problem there, but we will not provide help for installation or operating system-specific Python issues, so we highly recommend you complete it on Athena.

4. Queuing theory/connections (4 points). A small bank hires a management consultant to figure out if they can afford to advertise free checking for one year (a $150 value) to any customer who has to wait in line more than 15 minutes.  The consultant observes that, each minute that the bank is open, the waiting line gets longer by one customer with probability ¼, and – if there is a line – the line gets shorter by one customer (because a customer is served by a teller) with probability ¾.  Let X be the probability that the line never gets longer than 10 people in a 12-week period (this is a reference case, whose empirical frequency is known to the bank), and let Y be the probability that the line never gets longer than 15 people in a 12-week period (the proposed duration of the promotion). The bank is open 2400 minutes every week. Use an equation that was covered in class to calculate !"  (!)!"  (!). This scenario is analogous to finding local alignment of unrelated sequences of uniform composition, in which we expect a match with probability ¼ and a mismatch with probability ¾. That the bank line cannot go below 0 people is equivalent to resetting the local alignment score to 0 if the score becomes negative. The bank line getting longer by 1 and shorter by 1 corresponds to a match score of +1 and a mismatch score of -1, respectively. In the Gumbel distribution for BLAST statistics, MN=(length of database)(length of query) is the total size of the search space because in local alignment you consider starting a match at every position in the database vs. every position in the query. In the bank scenario, the “high scoring” run of the line increasing to over 10 or 15 people could begin at any minute, so the search spaces (=MN in the Gumbel distribution) are each (12 weeks*2400 minutes), respectively. Recall that λ is the unique positive solution to: !!  e!+!!  e!!=1, which corresponds to λ= ln(

4) Explain why these statements are true or false              ~ drugs that are very lipophilic tend to distribute well into body tissues.  ~ drugs that are predominantly ionized at physiologic pH do not readily distribute into tissues when compared to drugs that are primarily unionized. (Assuming  tight membrane junctions)                 ~ drugs are generally less well distributed to highly perfused tissues.        1 ~ the volume of distribution depends only on the degree of tissue binding.    (
5) The volume of distribution in a 70 kg man is observed to be 10 liters. Indicate which                one (or more) of the following statements is (are) consistent with the observation  when you consider that albumin has a volume of distribution of about 7 liters.                               ~ highly bound to plasma proteins  ~ does not pass any membranes  ~ not bound to plasma proteins  ~ low extraction drug        (
6) Select the correct answer(s). Due to the nature of biological membranes, drugs with   the following properties are more likely to cross most membrane barriers:               ~ ionized and lipophilic  ~ ionized and hydrophilic  ~ non-ionized and lipophilic  ~ non-ionized and hydrophilic      (

1) In increase in which of the following parameters will result in faster passive diffusion of a drug? Why or why not? ~ surface area of the absorption site – Yes: the rate of diffusion depends directly on the surface area across which diffusion occurs ~ membrane thickness – No: the rate of diffusion is inversely proportional to the “depth” of the medium through which the molecule diffuses (the membrane here) ~ partition coefficient of the drug between lipid and water – Yes: a larger partition coefficient means that the drug is more lipid soluble, which, to a point, will increase the date of diffusion across a lipid membrane. ~ gradient between drug concentrations on both sides of the membrane – Yes: the rate of diffusion is directly proportion to the size of the drug gradient ~ ATP-concentration in the membrane – No: ATP has nothing to do with diffusion (
2) As shown in the figure shown on the right, riboflavin (vitamin B
3) Which of the following drug formulations would lead to absorption of the drug into the general (systemic) circulation, thus bypassing the portal circulation?  How? ~ peptide nasal spray – Assuming that the possibly charged and hydrophilic (but nonetheless highly polar) peptide can cross the membranes of the epithelial lining of the nasal cavity, then a nasally administered peptide would enter the general circulation.  Blood flow from the lungs enters the venous return to the heart for distribution to the rest of the body. ~ nitroglycerin transdermal system – Yes, transdermally administered drug would enter the venous return from the skin, which enters the general venous blood flow to the heart. ~ intramuscular injection of penicillin G – Yes, injection into well vascularized muscle 1 tissue leads to venous uptake and entry into the general venous return to the heart. ~ injection into the cephalic vein of the forearm – Yes, an intravenous injection in the ~ antipyretic suppository – Yes, venous blood flow from the rectum leads to the general forearm bypasses the portal circulation circulation and not the portal circulation.  (
4) Explain why these statements are true or false  ~ drugs that are very lipophilic tend to distribute well into body tissues. True – lipophilic drugs will enter cells and tissues by passive diffusion and will distribute into lipid membranes and adipocytes. ~ drugs that are predominantly ionized at physiologic pH do not readily distribute into tissues when compared to drugs that are primarily unionized. (Assuming tight membrane junctions) Generally true, unless there is a specific drug transport protein for the charged form.  Uncharged molecules move more readily across lipid membranes than charged forms. ~ drugs are generally less well distributed to highly perfused tissues.  False – high rates of blood flow means a larger exposure of the cells in a tissue to the drug, which increases the rate of diffusion (maintains the gradient) or maintains a high local concentration for transport proteins. ~ the volume of distribution depends only on the degree of tissue binding.  False – Vd depends on the ability of a drug to leave the circulation (protein binding, for example) and to cross cell membranes (diffusion or transport protein), in addition to binding to lipids or proteins in tissues.    (
5) The volume of distribution in a 70 kg man is observed to be 10 liters. Indicate which one (or more) of the following statements is (are) consistent with the observation when you consider that albumin has a volume of distribution of about 7 liters. ~ highly bound to plasma proteins – Very consistent: albumin is the major plasma protein! ~ does not pass any membranes – Not necessarily true if there is a high level of plasma protein binding ~ not bound to plasma proteins – This is inconsistent with the observations ~ high first-pass metabolism in the liver – A high rate of metabolism in the liver would not necessarily lead to a larger Vd if plasma protein binding is high.  (
6) Select the correct answer(s). Due to the nature of biological membranes, drugs with the following properties are more likely to diffuse cross most membrane barriers:   ~ ionized and lipophilic – This is an oxymoron. ~ ionized and hydrophilic – Highly unlikely to diffuse across a lipid membrane without a transport protein ~ non-ionized and lipophilic – This is the state most likely to move by diffusion ~ non-ionized and hydrophilic – Less likely to move by diffusion, but it is possible   (
7) The larger the volume of distribution:  ~ the more sequestration may have occurred – True: binding in a tissue (e.g., adipose) could lead to a large Vd ~ the larger the plasma albumin binding – The two are not correlated.  High or low plasma  2 protein binding can occur with a large Vd ~ the higher the plasma clearance – True: the rate of removal of the drug from the blood will be higher if the drug has a large Vd, since, by definition, the drug is leaving the blood to move into tissues. ~ more drug is outside of the plasma – True: I hope that this is obvious!

The approach is to inhibit a key enzyme  involved in the cholesterol biosynthesis pathway. This enzyme, HMG-CoA reductase, is localized to the liver and serves as the rate controlling enzyme of  the mevalonate pathway, the metabolic pathway that produces cholesterol and  other isoprenoids. As the new head of the lab (and an expert in drug  transport), your main strategy is to utilize the liver’s capacity for active   uptake of xenobiotics to target the liver. You have received the following data  from some recent studies with your best compounds. Figure 1 shows the uptake  of four compounds into suspended rat hepatocytes.

1. Because you are losing the toxicity from the heterocyclic tertiary amine oxidation and the sulfur oxidation, but you still have major quinone toxicity.  I would say that the most important electrophile for each structure is phenol rings which can easily be converted to quinones. Quinones are powerful electrophilic Michael Acceptors that can react with cellular nucleophiles and form protein adducts. For example, neurotoxicity associated with Parkinson’s disease can be explained by para-quinone formed from the oxidation of dopamine, (Labenski et al

2) Explain the different pharmacokinetic behaviors of A and B. As noted above, the plasma  concentration profiles for both drugs are showing non-linear absorption from the peritoneal cavity and then non-linear elimination from the plasma. Drug B clearly has a lower AUC than drug A.  Since blood flow from the peritoneal cavity (blood vessels associated with the intestinal tract!) mainly enters the portal circulation, it is possible that the lower AUC for B results from B being metabolized to a greater extent than A in the liver. However, only one person caught the fact that  the drugs are excreted entirely unchanged in the urine!  I gave credit to any good explanation for the different AUCs.  It is possible that B is “trapped” in the peritoneal cavity by protein binding to a greater extent than A. Other reasonable explanations would also be accepted (e.g., B is  phagocytized by peritoneal macrophages – highly unlikely but biologically reasonable). It is also possible that the rate of plasma elimination of B is much higher than that of A, to cause lower  plasma levels at every measureable time point – unlikely but possible.  A.

3) Describe possible mechanisms that would account for the changes in the AUC values caused by co-administration of compound X in light of the lack of change in the plasma elimination kinetics. What additional information would you need to establish the mechanisms? 7 points The statement that Compound X was designed to interfere with Ha metabolism is a "red herring" -something to mislead you.  If this was the case, then the design did not work.  Co-administration of Compound X by either route does not affect the plasma elimination rate of Ha.  However, while the AUC for Ha does not change when it is co-administered with Compound X by the IV route, there is a significant decrease in the AUC when both drugs are administered by the oral route.  Since the rate of plasma elimination is not affected by Compound X or route of administration, then we must assume that hepatic metabolism and other elimination mechanisms are unaffected by Compound X.  The fact that Compound X reduces the AUC of Ha when administered by the oral route suggests that Compound X interferes with the uptake of Ha from the intestines, it enhances first-pass metabolism of Ha (but not overall hepatic metabolism since Kelim has not changed; this would be highly unlikely), or that it enhances the metabolism of Ha in intestinal epithelial cells following uptake from the gut lumen.  We could test the transport interference hypothesis using the in vitro models presented by Prolf. Hoffmaster. B. You compared dose-response behavior for Ha analogs B and C, as shown in the figure below.

1) There are three distinct phases apparent in the plasma pharmacokinetics of this drug.  Draw a graph and designate the three phases.  Explain what is happening during the first hour of the pharmacokinetic time-course and why the curve behaves as it does.  A plot of the data is shown above.  While the labeling requires information obtained in other parts of this question, you should have at least designated the three phases.  The data in the first hour show a non-linear increase in plasma concentration that is clearly not due to an intravenous injection or unlikely due to intravenous infusion, even if one did not assume instantaneous distribution following an I.V. injection.  So the drug was most likely administered by another route such as oral, dermal or other non-venous route.  Plots of both plasma concentration and ln«plasma concentration) versus time up to 1 hour after drug administration are nonlinear 3   and we really do not know why.  There are many possible explanations here and creative but sound explanations were rewarded.  A.
2) The pharmacokinetic behavior of the drug from 1 hr onward is unusual.  This is clearly not a case of rapid distribution of the drug into another compartment followed by slower plasma elimination, as we discussed for a pharmacokinetic model with two or more compartments.  Why not?  What information suggests that the drug is limited to a single compartment?  The volume of distribution of the drug is "4-7 L «depending on the size of the patient), so it is likely limited to the vascular compartment.  Thus, the two different phases apparent after 1 hr likely represent elimination of the drug by metabolism or excretion.  If there were a rapid distribution phase, then one would not expect to see the rather prolonged linear portion of the curve «i.e., zero-order kinetics) between 1 and 6 hr. A.

4) Describe two mechanisms that could explain the plasma pharmacokinetics in the second and third phases of the plasma elimination time course.  How would you establish which mechanism is actually responsible for the pharmacokinetics?  Early zero-order elimination kinetics suggests saturation of a transport protein or metabolic enzyme, with the plasma concentration eventually dropping below the Km of the enzyme or transporter and a resulting change to first-order kinetics.    There are many possible experiments that you could perform to distinguish the two mechanisms: measure the kinetics of metabolite formation, measure the transport 4 kinetics with an in vitro assay such as those described by Keith Hoffmaster, measure the kinetics of excretion in the urine for the drug and its metabolites.     10 pts.

1. Write a SHORT PROPOSAL-NIH Style on any biomechanical subject, using the guidelines that follow (you might find some of the papers from the reading list useful). 
2. Write a CRITICAL REVIEW that involves reading at least 5 papers, discussing the problems, methods, and conclusions in any area on which biomechanics may impinge. (We will hand out a reading list with some suggestions and examples of papers that you might find useful and interesting, but you are welcome to search for any others as well). The goal is to try and get an up-to-date review of the subjects as it currently stands and emphasize the outstanding questions that need to be addressed in the field.  Maximum length, excluding title page and reference list: 7 pages. Hints For Writing Short Proposals:The format for the proposal should be as follows.  Include a cover page with your name and the title of your proposal.  This page will not distributed to the “reviewers.”  The main body of the proposal will begin on the next page.  The page limit for the main body of the proposal (excluding the title page and references, but including everything else) is 7 pages.  Please number the pages of your proposal but do not put your name on any page except the cover page.  The body of the proposal should be organized into the following sections: A. Summary Page: Roughly 150 words.  Describe briefly what question you propose to study, why it is important, and what you plan to do.  Include the title again at the top of this page. B. Background and Significance: This section gives the reader an introduction to the problem that you propose to study.  It should briefly summarize the key ideas in the field and build up to the specific questions that you will pose.  Make sure you choose an interesting problem – grants in the real world are penalized harshly if they simply attempt to cross the T’s and dot the I’s of previous work.  Suggested length: ~ 1-2 pages. C. Specific Aims: List the two or three specific questions or hypotheses that you will test.  State the aims in as direct and simple a manner as possible.  This section should be extremely short (one to two sentences for each aim). D. Methods: This is the meat of the proposal in which you describe exactly what you propose to do, how you would do it, what results you might obtain, how you would interpret those results, and what pitfalls or problems might present difficulties in your approach.  Here are some other (potentially relevant) issues that you might discuss: Are there any technical difficulties that might make your approach impractical?  Do you have a backup plan if things go wrong?  Are there alternative interpretations?  If so, is there a follow-up study that could disambiguate the interpretation? You can organize this section any way you like, However, you should certainly lay it out according to your specific aims.  Have one subsection on the first specific aim. and so on.  In each of these subsections, be specific enough so that we will understand what you are planning to do. References:  List references that document your point in all the previous sections. There is no need to provide a summary or conclusion at the end of your proposal. You may, however, want to include a brief section called “Future Directions” in which you explain where this work might lead in the future, and what further issues could be addressed once you know the answers to the questions at hand. Remember a good grant communicates to the reviewers clearly and simply what you are planning to do and why it is important.  Assume that the reviewers are looking for excuses to reject your proposal. Reviewers in the real world get annoyed: (

1.  A company has begun to market a fibronectin-coated cell culture dish.  You are considering the purchase of culture dishes for your in vitro study of a cell type for which you have relatively little information.  You have been able to determine, however, that the cell has the 61 integrin.  Would you expect there to be any benefit to using the fibronectin-coated dish?  Explain.  
2.  Another company provides you with their new culture dish (not the fibronectin-coated dish above).

Explain. b)  Name 2 other tissues that you would expect to be abnormal and 2 other tissues that you would anticipate would be normal?  Explain.     MIT OpenCourseWarehttp://ocw.mit.edu
1.  The ligand for the 61 integrin is laminin, not fibronectin.  Therefore, one might not expect much binding of the cells to the fibronectin-coated dish.   
2.  The cells are attaching to the conventional dishes, even though the dishes are not pre-coated with an adhesion protein, because the cells are synthesizing their own adhesion proteins, which are becoming adsorbed to the dish and subsequently serve as binding sites for the cells; the cells have integrins to the adhesion proteins that they make.  The new dishes may not have a chemical composition that allows for adsorption of the adhesion proteins produced by the cells.   
3. a)  One explanation for the inability of the dermis to heal by contraction like it normally does is that the fibroblasts are not able to bind to the matrix molecules (viz., collagen).  The likely missing cell adhesion molecule is an integrin for fibronectin (or collagen).

2.  One method of treatment of the torn cuff is to suture the ends together.

Note that we do not expect you to reproduce every single data point in the paper;  rather, it is left to your judgment to identify the key, most discriminating tests to assure that you’ve correctly implemented the model. You should then examine the behavior of the system by computational experiments.  For example, alter, add, or subtract a particular step in the underlying mechanism and determine the consequences.

The cells closest to the center experience the highest levels of force and are torn loose from the substrate.

1.  A new company, Polycoat, offers a service to orthopedic companies in which they apply a polymer coating, 100 nm thick, to cobalt-chromium alloy prostheses.  The coating contains calcium phosphate particles, 10 nm in diameter.  The putative benefits of the coating are: 
2) water absorbed by the polymer will slowly dissolve the particles thereby releasing calcium, which will favorably affect nearby osteoblasts.  You have been hired by an orthopedic company to help them analyze Polycoat-coated prostheses and review data from Polycoat. a. 	 It is important to verify that the calcium phosphate particles are within 5 nm of the surface of the Polycoat coating.  Given that you can employ only one of the following methods which would you chose and what would you measure:  infrared spectroscopy, ESCA, X-ray diffraction?  Explain. b. 	 Polycoat states that there should be no concern about loose calcium phosphate particles on the surface of the coating because their conventional light microscopy studies have not revealed particles on the surface.  Is there anything that you would recommend relative to this issue? c. 	 In reference to the hydrophobic-hydrophilic character of the coating, Polycoat determined the contract angle of water on the surface of the coating.  What information would you request about the conditions under which the contact angle measurement was made?  What type of contact angle measurement would you require for this coating?

2. Assume for the moment that the cells in this system act noncooperatively, i.e., independently of each other. Derive a mathematical relation between the limiting value of df(t)/dt at t = 0, i.e., (df/dt)0, and the cell density D. 
3. Tests for cell-cooperativity. (A) Assume that a problem has developed in your laboratory with the cell culture medium. As a result, the cells have started to behave irreproducibly after staying 4 h in the medium. You are limited to data obtained before t = 4 h. Can data obtained at t <4 h be used to detect the presence or absence of cell-cell cooperativity in the data? Explain briefly. (B) The same equation (see above) has been used to fit separately each of the curves in Fig. 
4. In the articles by Freyman et al. the asymptotic force per cell was calculated as the total force f∞ generated by the cells divided by the number of attached cells. Describe an experimental method, using an instrument(s) and an experimental configuration of your choice, that can be used to measure the force per cell directly (i.e., not calculated from the data in Fig. 
5. You are managing the quality control department of a plant that manufactures matrix similar to the one used in the studies of Freyman et al. The matrix is sold to researchers of cell-matrix interactions who use it as a research tool to identify the integrins that are utilized during such interactions, the identity of ligands on the matrix, etc. Your manufacturing specifications are based entirely on quality control data of the type represented by Eq. 
1. Having conducted preliminary studies you have found out that the mass of bound TGFβ1, m, is directly proportional to the specific surface, σ, of a series of scaffolds. where C is a constant of proportionality. The specific surface, σ, of scaffolds is known to depend on the pore size, d, by the following relation (Gibson and Ashby, 
1) What are two principal issues which would have to be addressed relative to this approach? (
2) When this procedure was performed in an animal model it as found that a layer of macrophages was on the silicone samples when they were retrieved after 6 months.  One of your colleagues has notified the CEO that this is cause to search for another elastomeric polymer for this application, because the presence of the macrophages indicates that the silicone rubber being used is not biocompatible.  Do you agree?  Explain. (
3) When the silicone sample (above) was removed from the animal it was found to be encapsulated in a layer of tissue a few millimeters thick.  Write the unit cell process(es) related to the formation of this tissue capsule. 1 D.  (20%)  As an alternative approach to the treatment of the defect in Fig. 1b, your company has developed a sponge-like absorbable scaffold to fill the defect to facilitate regeneration.  The least expensive approach would be to have a one-piece sponge-like scaffold fill the defect. (

1.  that remains untreated (typically due to unavailability of medical care in certain developing economies). Such chronic wounds can be deep, extending into the  stroma and eventually closing by contraction and scar formation, processes  which block vision. Typically, one eye only is compromised by this condition;  however, both eyes may eventually also get involved..   You are working as a consultant in a medical device company that is interested in designing a device to be used in inducing regeneration of the diseased conjunctiva. The device that you will design will be placed in contact with a surgically induced full-thickness square wound, initially measuring 2 x 2 mm2 in area, in the diseased conjunctiva. A successful device will induce regeneration of all three tissues of the conjunctiva, with recovery of function in less than 8 weeks.   eye has been affected at the time of treatment. Also assume that the conjunctiva has a morphology that is very similar (though not identical) to that of the skin of a rodent. You will also assume that the full-thickness conjunctival wound responds to regenerative treatment by a successfully selected device as if it were a full-thickness wound in the skin of a rodent. Obviously, approximating the conjunctival wound with a skin wound is a first-order approximation that only serves as a screening tool, of help in selecting a basic design strategy from among several strategies that have no chance of providing a useful answer.   that have been made to you by coworkers or suppliers of medical reagents or devices.  For each suggestion, please provide either a positive or negative response and provide a brief explanation for your selection. A negative response implies that the suggestion has practically no chance of leading to a regenerated conjunctiva (little or no efficacy) or that the suggestion comes with an unacceptably high cost to the patient (little or no safety). A positive response does not guarantee success; however, it suggests that the selection has the potential of eventually providing a useful device provided other requirements are included in a future design (high efficacy) and that it is generally safe (high safety).  Listed below are various suggestions for potentially regenerative devices D. Continuous infusion into the wound over 14 days of a low-molecular  B. A porous copolymer of lactic acid/glycolic acid, comonomer ratio 75/25, Your brief response for each selection should address both the efficacy and safety issues.  Perfect efficacy implies regeneration of all three conjunctival tissue types. If unsure about the safety of a substance of device, you must conclude that the safety is not high and must be specifically tested for.    A. An autologous cell culture comprising mature cells from the epithelial tissue layer of the conjunctiva from the uninfected eye will be drizzled onto the surgically wounded conjunctiva at the rate of about 2 million cells per day for a period of 14 days.   that degrades with a half-life of 14 days, average pore size 100 μm, with randomly oriented pore channels is grafted on the wound.   C. A porous scaffold identical to that described in B above except seeded  with 3 million epithelial conjunctival cells, identical to cells described in A above, is grafted on the wound. The cells have been seeded into the scaffold prior to grafting of the scaffold on the wound.   weight substance X that blocks the intracellular pathway responsible for synthesis of alpha smooth muscle actin by fibroblasts. Substance X has been studied in vitro; no in vivo studies of X have been made.   E. A porous collagen/GAG scaffold, degrading with a half-life of 12 days, average pore diameter 100 μm, pore channels randomly oriented. No cells have been seeded into the scaffold prior to grafting on the wound.       Solutions. A. This approach is expected to have no efficacy since epithelial cells by themselves are known not to synthesize the stroma in skin wounds. Its safety can be high by making sure that the autologous epithelial cells are extracted from the surgically removed conjunctival tissues that were procured when the wound in the dysfunctional eye was surgically generated. However, the design would have very low safety if it calls for extraction of cells from a biopsy of healthy conjunctival tissue from the patient’s healthy eye (since it will threaten loss of normal vision in the remaining healthy eye). B. The synthetic polymer has no efficacy because it lacks ligands for binding integrins of contractile fibroblasts. Even if there is nonspecific binding on the synthetic polymer surface, absent specific ligands there is little expectation that contraction blocking (a requirement for regeneration) will occur. The safety of the device is questionable: Even though it will eventually degrade in 2-3 weeks, the product of degradation of each of the comonomers is a pH-lowering substance (e.g., lactic acid) that should cause a local inflammatory response. C. This system suffers from lack of specific ligands, as in section B above, and cannot block contraction. Seeding with epithelial cells may possibly lead to synthesis of an epithelial tissues but the stroma will still be missing because it requires the presence of an active scaffold that can induce changes in the phenotype of contractile fibroblasts.  D. Induced regeneration consists of two steps: wound contraction blocking and synthesis of new stroma. The expected efficacy could be high since the substance will probably result in contraction blocking, a prerequisite to regeneration. However, in the absence of a scaffold that can act as a template for synthesis of new stroma, it is questionable whether new stroma will be synthesized at all. The safety of the substance is unknown and it must therefore be assumed to be low and that it requires testing for toxicity.  E. This scaffold is DRT, which is known to lead to regeneration of the stroma. Epithelial tissue will not be specifically induced to regenerate by use of the unseeded scaffold. However, for a small-area wound, as this 2 x 2 mm2 wound is, it is expected that epithelial tissue will migrate from the wound edges toward the wound center, with synthesis of the epithelial tissue and spontaneous synthesis of basement membrane. (This process works well with skin wounds that have been grafted with a keratinocyre-seeded DRT.) Efficacy should be high. Since all three tissue types will be synthesized. Safety should also be high since this scaffold has passed clinical trials in its use as a device that regenerates skin and peripheral nerves.    MIT OpenCourseWarehttp://ocw.mit.edu 
1.  The  paper  titled  “Dendritic  cells  loaded  with  stressed  tumor  cells  elicit  long-lasting  protective  tumor  immunity  in  mice  depleted  of  CD4+CD25+  regulatory  Tcells”  by  Prasad  et  al.  reports  that  stressed  and  gamma-irradiated  syngeneic tumor cells elicit protective CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses in the absence of dendritic cell (DC) maturation.  In the absence of infectious non-self (i.e. pattern recognition receptor [PRR] agonists) do you think necrotic cells or apoptotic cells would be more effective at inducing DC activation?  Explain your reasoning. 
2.  In  the  paper  titled  “Involvement  of  chemokine  receptors  in  breast  cancer metastasis”  by  Müller  et  al.,  migration  and  invasion  were  assayed  using fibronectin- or Matrigel-coated cell culture inserts (chemotaxis or chemoinvasion assays).

What  is  the  relationship  betweenRappaport’s hepatic acinus and the classical hepatic lobule?  (You may use an explanation and/or an illustration to answer the last part of this question). 
4. “Cross-priming” refers to the activation of naive cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL; CD8+  T  cells)  by  antigen-presenting  cells  (APC)  that  have  acquired  nominal antigens  from  another  cell.    Although  injection  of  mice  with  MHC-mismatched cells expressing minor H antigens has been shown to prime self-MHC-restricted CTL  responses  specific  for  the  minor  H  antigens,  the  biological  relevance  of cross-priming in protective immunity against viral infection remains controversial. Describe  one  experiment  that  could  be  performed  to  test  that  hypothesis  that virus-specific  CTL  are  elicited  by  cross-priming.    Be  sure  to  state  why  the experimental result supports (or refutes) the hypothesis, and how you control for direct priming. 
5. Answer the following question posted on a hepatitis B virus (HBV) testing and prevention web forum. I  donated  blood  and  the  results  came  back  positive  for  anti-nucleocapsid  core  protein (anti-HBc) only.  Although the blood was trashed, I thought this might have been a false positive result.  I donated blood a second time and got no notification that there were any problems with my blood, and I was asked to donate again in the future - which I did. Now the third time I donated, I was again anti-HBc positive only.  Now I am told that I should  never  again  in  my  entire  life  donate  blood.    First  of  all,  why  would  my  future donations be denied if I am not a carrier (I wasn’t positive for anything else)?  It seems to me  that  HBV  isn’t  a  death  sentence  for  most  people  –  greater  than  90%  clear  the infection.    Aren’t  the  odds  of  transmitting  HBV  from  a  person  who  has  cleared  the infection via blood transfusion very low?  Since we are desperate for donors, is this really a necessary precaution? 
1.  An  association  between  Helicobacter  hepaticus  infection  and  hepatocellulartumors  in  susceptible  strains  of  laboratory  mice  has  been  proven.    What evidence  would  be  needed link  between  enterohepatic Helicobacter  species  (i.e.  non-gastric  Helicobacter  species)  infection  and  liver cancer  in  humans?  Describe  the  kinds  of  studies  and  findings  that  you  think would lead the International Agency for Research on Cancer to include infection with  enterohepatic  Helicobacter  species  along  with  infection  with  Helicobacter pylori, schistosomes, and liver flukes as being carcinogenic to humans (Group

3.  It  has  been  suggested  that  hepatocellular  tumors  in  rodents  treated  with chemical carcinogens develop from foci of altered hepatocytes.  These foci have altered  phenotypes  based  on  their  histochemical  appearance  (i.e.  increased  γ-glutamyl  transferase  [γ-GT]  expression).  However,  the  functional  changes  in these foci that confer malignant potential are not understood.  What do you thinkare the main advantages and limitations of using (A) genomic and (B) proteomic analysis  to  characterize  these  altered  foci?    What  are  your  main  technical  andconceptual  concerns  (i.e.  potential  problems)  about  using  these  approaches  to ascertain the role of altered foci in hepatic carcinogenesis? BE.450 final exam Name 
4. What do you think is the best currently available animal model for human viral hepatitis leading to hepatocellular carcinoma?  You should define what you mean by best, and can limit your comparison to hepatitis B virus, hepatitis C virus, or both.  Be sure to explain your reasoning. BE.450 final exam Name 
5.  It  has  been  argued  that  the  only  real  value  of  randomized,  controlled chemoprevention  studies  is  that  they  can  demonstrate  sufficient  weight  of evidence to justify committing immense resources to primary prevention efforts. Do  you  think  that  intervention  with  micronutrients  or  pharmaceutical  agents  to prevent hepatocellular carcinoma in parts of the world with high rates of aflatoxin exposure  and  hepatitis  virus  infection  is  worthwhile,  or  do  you  think  thatprevention  should  focus  exclusively  on  eliminating  food  contaminants  and vaccination?  Explain your reasoning. 
1)  What 2 issues would argue against the use of the porous material alone (i.e., non-cell-seeded) for this application, with respect to the likelihood that the scaffold would become infiltrated by host cells? 
2)  What pore diameter range would you expect to be best for this application?  Briefly explain. 
3)  Is there an additional surgical procedure that could be performed at the time of placement of the implant that you could propose to increase the likelihood that the scaffold would become infiltrated with host cells?  Briefly explain. 
4)  If you were to use cells grown outside the body to seed the scaffold before implantation what would you propose as the source of the cells?  Note the key advantage and the principal disadvantage. 
5)  Would you propose the use of the non-absorbable or absorbable form of CAR for this application?  Briefly explain. c. 	 The company would also like to develop an implant to treat defects that go through the articular cartilage into the underlying bone; consider a defect that is 5mm in diameter and 10mm long.  Which material or combination of the Company’s materials would you propose for this application.  Explain your selection of material(s).  Keep in mind the importance of rationalizing any complexities relative to cost. 3 
1) 	 One issue is that cells from the surrounding articular cartilage would not migrate into the scaffold because they are constrained within their extracellular matrix.  The same could be said of the cells in the bone underlying the defect. Also cells may not proliferate rapidly enough within the scaffold and/or not synthesize enough new matrix. Another issue is the absence of a blood supply so that a fibrin clot would not form within the scaffold and also blood-borne growth factors would not be present. 
2)  Pore diameter should be large enough to accommodate the size of a few cells (cells are about 10µm in diameter each) and allow room for the newly synthesized extracellular matrix. 1 
3)  The surgeon could put holes into the underlying bone to allow bleeding into the defect to form a fibrin clot and to allow marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells to infiltrate (migrate into) the clot. 
4)  Cells could be autologous (from the same patient) taken from a biopsy of cartilage (differentiated chondrocytes).  The advantage is that the cells are already differentiated chondrocytes.  The disadvantage is the donor site morbidity and that the donor tissue is not readily accessible. Cells could be allogeneic (from anther individual) taken from cartilage (differentiated chondrocytes).  The advantages are that the cells are already differentiated chondrocytes and there is no donor site morbidity.  The disadvantage is the potential for transmission of disease and immune response. Autologous marrow-derived stem cells could be used.  The advantage is that they are more readily accessible than chondrocytes.  The potential problem is that they may not differentiate into chondrocytes, and may differentiate into unwanted cell types. 
5)  An absorbable form of CAR would be best for this application.  If a non­absorbable form were to be used the presence of the material could adversely affect the mechanical behavior of the tissue and interfere with tissue formation. c. 	 May be best to start with the porous absorbable forms of CAR and BON bonded to each other.  Stem cells derived from bone marrow that infiltrate (migrate into) the pores of the BON material might differentiate into bone and the stem cells migrating into the CAR portion in the superficial region of the defect might form cartilage.  If this does not work out, one might seed the CAR portion of the implant with autologous chondrocytes prior to implantation. 2

1) in the form of predefined pathways, while at the same time allowing a user to explore novel networks composed computationally from the universe of interactions underlying the predefined pathways. Current knowledge of the components of any given biological process is uneven. For example, for some protein interactants the precise post-translational modifications might be known, while for other interactants perhaps the only sure knowledge is that the protein is “active”. PID provides descriptive mechanisms to cover both of these cases. The ability to represent information at different levels of detail is also useful in communicating generalizations. For example, it is sometimes useful to encapsulate a complex process such as cytoskeleton reorganization as a single event or to treat as a single entity a set of proteins such as Class 1A PI3Ks that are functionally equivalent in catalyzing a given event. PID has mechanisms for dealing with incomplete knowledge, for encapsulating complex events and for expressing generalizations.   2 PID has adopted a network-level representation, similar to Reactome (

Your research team at a startup company is working on using biodegradable polymers as scaffolds to promote bone regeneration.  You have found that a polyanhydride, poly(carboxyphenoxyhexane) (PCH, structure shown below), has good mechanical properties for this application.  However, porous bone scaffolds with mean strut dimensions of 250 µm (as illustrated below) degrade by surface erosion and this causes the scaffold to loosen in its position when implanted at a bone defect. Show that the erosion number calculated for this situation agrees with the experimental observation. c. 	 You’d like to engineer your PCH scaffolds to degrade by bulk erosion.  Your colleagues suggest that the problem could be overcome by blending PCH with poly(ethylene glycol), which will phase separate and raise the average diffusion constant of water in the matrix to a value one tenth that of water’s natural self-diffusion coefficient (water diffusion in water). Will this drive the scaffold to erode by a bulk mechanism? (Defend your answer with a calculation).  An alternative proposal is to make the struts of the scaffold thinner.

1. 	 Listed in the table below are chemical and schematic structures of poly(L-lactide) and a number of derivatives of this polymer. a. 	 Using physicochemical criteria, predict the hierarchy of degradation rates for these materials.  Provide a concise but thorough explanation of your ranking.  State any assumptions you make. Experiments reveal that these materials ranked in terms of their rate of degradation have the following order: polycaprolactone (PCL) < poly(L-lactide) (PLLA) < poly(lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA) < poly(lactide-b-ethylene oxide) (PLA-b-PEO). This ranking can be rationalized via the chemical and physicochemical factors that control degradation rates:  Because all of the materials are comprised of degradable ester linkages, they cannot be differentiated based on purely labile bond differences.  The two slowest-degrading materials have a number of factors lowering their degradation rate: They are both semicrystalline.  PLLA has the pendant methyl groups creating a steric barrier to the approach of water to the backbone.  PCL is more hydrophobic and generally is highly crystalline, because its linear backbone readily packs into extensive crystallites (relative to PLLA).  PLGA breaks down more quickly than PLLA because the mixture of lactide and glycolide repeat units in the chain prevents crystallization, and glycolide, lacking the bulky methyl groups, is more readily attacked by water.  Lastly, PLA-b-PEO, though crystallizable, are much more quickly degraded than the other materials due to the greatly enhanced entry of water into the hydrophilic PEO domains. b. 	 State 2 physical properties/parameters you would measure for each polymer to make your ranking more accurate, and explain your choices. Key properties that are not immediately obvious from the given information would be the percent crystallinity in the samples and their glass transition temperatures.  For the block copolymer, one would like to know whether the crystallinity is present in both PLA and PEO blocks or only the PLA blocks.

Assuming a saturated salt solution and compressibility of the fluids, we can solve this problem in the following fashion:Incompressibility of the fluids ensures that the flux of water through the semipermeable membrane (JW above) must equal the flux of drug out of the chamber (JD above), because any volume of water that enters the osmotic chamber must displace the piston to the right and drive an equal volume of drug solution out of the device: JW  = −JD

1.  Physically associating polymers are used as drug carriers, tissue bulking agents, and cell delivery scaffolds.   a.  Explain why physical hydrogels are most often formed using block copolymers, where polymer chains are made up of repeating stretches of monomers which can take part in physical cross-links. Single physical cross-links, formed by hydrophobic association/Van der Waals bonding, ionic bonding, or hydrogen bonding between two monomers in water, have significantly lower strengths than single covalent bonds (10-100-fold lower bond energies).  Thus, formation of even transiently stable hydrogels (or micelles) requires block copolymer structures where cooperative binding can occur between bonding blocks of two chains. Formation of one physical bond is immediately followed by bonding of several other adjacent monomer units, ‘zipping up’ a physical contact between two chains. b.

1. 	 (50 points) Compare and contrast a natural extracellular matrix based on collagen fibers with a synthetic matrix formed by a covalent PEG-based hydrogel containing –APGL- peptide linkages sensitive to the enzyme collagenase—answer in brief paragraphs: a.  Structurally, do these gels present the same barrier to cell movement/migration? A homogeneous covalent synthetic hydrogel will differ significantly in structure from a collagen fiber matrix.  Collagen gels are typically formed via temperature-driven self-assembly of collagen triple helices into fibrils, and these fibrils can in turn assemble into fibers, which have cross-sections ranging from several hundred nanometers to 1 or 2 microns.  These fibers, which can extend tens to hundreds of microns in the axial length, then form a gel by physical entanglement, with a mesh size which is often 100’s of nanometers and can be microns.  In contrast, covalent gels form with the mesh size determined by the molecular weight between crosslinks, and because the mesh size is determined by such a molecular length scale, the mesh size rarely exceeds ~10 nm (the molecular weights required for larger mesh sizes are typically difficult to achieve in practice).  Thus, a very different physical environment is presented to cells by these two structures.  In addition, as a barrier to migration, collagen, because it is a physical network formed by entanglement of fibers, can be re-arranged/disrupted by cells themselves, while a covalent gel can only be disrupted by the action of cell-derived enzymes on the protease-sensitive peptide linkages of the network.  Altogether, cells will be able to migrate more quickly through a native collagen matrix than the synthetic ECM. b.   Which type of gel would you predict to be more rapidly degraded in vivo?  Why? It is highly likely that a native collagen gel will degrade more quickly than a synthetic protease-sensitive gel.  First, the collagen gel will contain multiple degradation sites within each fibril/triple helix, which may be recognized by a broader array of degradative enzymes than the synthetic gel with its minimal peptide epitopes.  Second, the small mesh size of the covalent gel will slow diffusion of remodeling enzymes through the matrix, further slowing its degradation. c. 	In vivo, cells in either of these matrices will also be surrounded by other cells and ECM components.  In what ways would you expect these matrices to differ in the way they mediate the interactions of cells with their surroundings?

(10 points) Two strategies to achieve zero-order release are to use a reservoir/membrane device or to encapsulate the drug in a surface-eroding degradable polymer.  Cite a principle advantage of each of these strategies for the given application (one sentence each) and a principle limitation (one sentence for each approach). Reservoir device: Advantages: Sustained release over very long times—up to years—is readily achieved by tuning the diffusion coefficient of drug passage through the membrane material.  The kinetics of drug release are well-described by simple models that quantitatively predict device function.   Disadvantages: Danger of ‘dose dumping’—immediate release of the entire payload of drug if the membrane is physically compromised.  By design, these membranes are prepared from permanent materials and require surgical retrieval at the end of their useful lifetime (if they were biodegradable, the release rate would vary with time). Typical solid polymer membranes used as reservoir devices (e.g., poly(dimethyl siloxane)) have very low permeability for protein drugs. Surface-eroding degradable matrix: Advantages: A biodegradable matrix requires no surgery for recovery, and the system is free from ‘dose dumping’ issues. By formulating matrices in the form of microspheres, this controlled release system can be injected instead of implanted by surgery. Disadvantages: The key limitation of surface-eroding matrices is the intrinsic coupling between degradation rate and the surface erosion mode of degradation: surface-eroding polymers are generally fast-degrading polymers, thus limiting the time that a given matrix can continue to release a given therapeutic drug.

3.   You catch two fruit flies; one of these flies is male and the other is female.  Both flies have a very unusual phenotype: blue eyes and white body color. You put these flies in a vial and several days later, you return to find that this vial is full of blue-eyed, white-bodied flies!  The two flies that you caught have mated and it turns out that they are true breeding for the alleles that determine eye and body color!  You decide to find out if the genes that determine these two traits are linked or unlinked.  When you come back to the lab, you discover that all of your blue-eye, white-body color flies have died except for one female.  You are determined to test for gene linkage, though.  To do so, you need to accomplish the following two tasks:  •  First, you need to generate more blue-eye, white-body color flies by designing mating experiments using your one remaining blue-eye, white-body color female and a common laboratory fruit fly stock with a well characterized genetic background.   •  Following this, you can perform mating experiment to determine if the two genes that determine the traits of interest are linked.  a) Give the phenotype of the two flies in the “strains window” available for your initial mating experiment.

1. iii.  What do the results of Experiment 2 suggest about the distance between the genes that regulate It suggests that the two genes in question are located on the same chromosome but they are 50 map units or 50cM apart that allows them to recombine to produce four gametes with equal frequency each having a different genotype i.e. these genes are unlinked and they assort as per the Mendelian genetics.  body color and wing type? 3Question 3 You are working with flies that can be broadly categorized as aggressive or mild and red or grey. You decide to study the genes responsible for these two traits. Note: Use the letters “A”, and “a” for temperament (aggressive or mild) and “B” and “b” for body color (red or grey). Use the uppercase letter to represent the alleles associated with the dominant phenotypes and the lowercase letters to represent the alleles associated with the recessive phenotypes.   a) You mate a true breeding aggressive and red fly with a mild and grey fly.  You find that all the flies in the F1 generation are aggressive and grey. You take an F1 generation female fly and test cross her with a true breeding male fly and score 1600 progeny. i.  Give the genotype and phenotype of the male fly in the test cross. Phenotype:   mild & red   If the genes for the two characters (traits) are 10cM apart, write the genotypes and corresponding phenotypes of the different classes of flies that you would expect. Also write the approximate number of flies that you would expect for each class. Genotype:  aabb    ii.

You perform the following crosses. •  You cross a true breeding fly having grey body color and long antennae with a true breeding fly having red body color and short antennae.  A test cross with a resulting F1 fly gives 320 recombinant progeny from a total of 1600 flies in F
2.    •  You cross a true breeding aggressive fly having long antennae with a true breeding mild fly with short antennae. A test cross with a resulting F1 fly gives 480 recombinant progeny from a total of 1600 flies in F
3.   You catch two fruit flies; one of these flies is male and the other is female.  Both flies have a very unusual phenotype: blue eyes and white body color. You put these flies in a vial and several days later, you return to find that this vial is full of blue-eyed, white-bodied flies!  The two flies that you caught have mated and it turns out that they are true breeding for the alleles that determine eye and body color!  You decide to find out if the genes that determine these two traits are linked or unlinked.  When you come back to the lab, you discover that all of your blue-eye, white-body color flies have died except for one female.  You are determined to test for gene linkage, though.  To do so, you need to accomplish the following two tasks:  6 Question 6 continued   •  First, you need to generate more blue-eye, white-body color flies by designing mating experiments using your one remaining blue-eye, white-body color female and a common laboratory fruit fly stock with a well characterized genetic background.   •  Following this, you can perform mating experiment to determine if the two genes that determine the traits of interest are linked.  a) Give the phenotype of the two flies in the “strains window” available for your initial mating experiment. Note: Click on each fly to view its phenotype. Male Fly:  Grey body & red eye  Female fly: White body color and blue eye 	   b) To generate more flies with blue eyes and white body color, you set up a mating experiment between the two available flies. Note: You can set up a mating experiment by dragging the chosen parent flies to the Mating site and then clicking on the “MATE” button. Mating results are summarized on the Summary. You can also view the phenotypes by clicking the “SUMMARY->SHOW TAB” tab.   how many of each type you observe. i.  Describe the different phenotype(s) that you observe among the 50 F1 progeny and indicate 32 males with grey body color and blue eyes and 28 females with grey body color and red eye (Note: the numbers can be different for each experiment but the ratio should be approx 1:

The direction of transcription is determined by the location of the promoter, which is always located prior to the transcribed region of the gene. Therefore for Gene 1, the bottom strand is the template DNA strand that is read 3’->5’ by the RNA polymerase to make the mRNA in a 5’->3’ direction. In comparison, for Gene 2, the top strand is the template DNA strand that is read 3’->5’ by the RNA polymerase to make the mRNA in a 5’->3’ direction.  ii.

State the effect of each of these mutations on the peptides produced.  The 27th base in the non-template strand of Gene 1 was changed from T to A. i. The 4th base in the non-template strand of Gene 2 was changed from A to T. The 49th base in the non-template strand of Gene 2 was changed from G to T. The 5’GUG3’ splice site is lost. Accordingly, the intron will not be spliced out. The peptide produced will be longer, misfolded and most likely non-functional.   ii. A pre-mature stop codon will be inserted resulting in a truncated non-functional peptide. This is an example of nonsense mutation.  iii. This will result in the loss of first start codon. The 2nd start codon will be used to make the protein. The mRNA will be read in a different frame. Therefore the resulting peptide will have a different amino acid sequence and will be non-functional.   The 47th base in the non-template strand of Gene 3 was changed from C to T. iv. This mutation creates a new 3’splice acceptor site (3’UUG). This is an example of a mutation that changes the reading frame of mature mRNA and therefore the amino acid sequence of the resulting peptide.

3. The recipient immune system may elicit an immune response to the virus. Or the virus may itself prove toxic to the recipient.  c) Your supervisor suggests that you use embryonic cells instead of liver cells for ex-vivo gene therapy. Explain what may be the potential advantage of using embryonic cells compared to the liver cells.  (NOT GRADED) Embryonic cells are pluripotent and can therefore acquire different cell fates.  They can also serve as the precursor for the germ-line cells. If this is the case, then the defect can be cured not only in the individual produced from the developing embryo but also in his descendants. Also, since the embryonic cells are undifferentiated cells they may better adopt to expressing new proteins.   d) You isolate embryonic cells from an affected mouse (genotype: aa) and infect them with a viral vector that has a wild- type allele of Gene A. You select the cells that have been infected with the virus containing the wild- type copy of Gene A and re-introduce them into the developing embryo of the affected mouse to obtain newborns. You trace the location and expression of Gene A in the newborn mice by adding a blue color dye that specifically binds to the protein encoded by Gene A. You obtain the following two sets of results. Note: You may assume that the level of expression of the Gene A correlates with the intensity of the blue color in the cells. In wild-type mice, the dye stains only the liver cells.    •  Set 1:  When you add the dye you find that most of cells in the mouse, including the liver cells, turn blue.  •  Set 2:  Based on the results of Set 1, you modify your viral vector that contains Gene A, reinsert it into the embryonic cells and obtain newborns by following the same steps that were described above. When you add the dye you find that only the liver cells turn blue and the color is of the same intensity as in the liver cells of wild-type mice.  In addition, these mice do not show the manifestations of the disease.   How did you modify the viral vector so that the introduced Gene A was expressed only in the liver cells of newborns obtained in Set 2?  The introduced gene in Set 1 is under the regulation of a generic promoter. In contrast, the introduced gene in Set 2 is under the regulation of a tissue specific promoter.  e) You isolate the cell from a developing embryo (at the blastula stage/ 8– cell stage) that is produced by the fusion of gametes from affected parents (genotype: aa).   You infect these cells with a modified vector from Set 2 that has a wild type copy of Gene A. You then select the cells that have undergone homologous recombination and now have a wild-type copy of Gene A. You re-introduce them into the developing embryo (genotype: aa) to obtain newborns.  (NOT GRADED)   i.  Give all the possible genotypes of the newborn obtained from this strategy? Briefly explain why  you selected this genotype. Note: Use the uppercase A to represent the allele responsible for the dominant phenotype and lowercase a to represent the allele responsible for the recessive phenotype. This strategy will produce a chimeric mouse. This mouse will have some cell- types that will be derived from the modified embryonic cells where one allele associated with the disease has been replaced by a wild- type copy of the Gene A through homologous recombination (genotype Aa). The same mouse will also have some other cell-types that are derived from the original embryonic cells  (genotype aa) that did not receive a wild-type copy of Gene A. So the genotype of this chimeric mouse will be Aa in some cell- types and aa in other cell-types based on the embryonic cell types from which they originated through cell divisions.    7    Question 4 continued ii.  You allow the newborn obtained from the strategy outlined above to mate with a wild- type female mouse (genotype: AA). Would you expect all the mice from this mating experiment to have a normal phenotype (Yes/ No)? Explain why you selected this option. The gametes derived from the mouse obtained by strategy 2 can either have “a” or “A’ genotypes. When they fuse with the gametes of a wild- type female (genotype “A”) they will produce newborns that can either have AA or Aa genotype and will therefore be phenotypically normal.            8 MIT OpenCourseWarehttp://ocw.mit.edu

1. Promutagen Carcinogen but not a mutagen   Circle the option from the choices below that best characterizes B(a)P and explain why you selected this option.   B (a)P is a promutagen, which is not cancer causing in its native form. However, as shown by Experiment 2 and Experiment 3, the metabolic enzymes present in the liver extract and different tissues of the experimental mice convert the B(a)P from its pro-mutagenic form into a metabolic form(s) that is mutagenic. Hence you see the development of solid tumor in experimental mice and reversion of His- bacterial cells to His+ bacterial cells in Experiment 3, which form colonies on the plate that has a selection growth media that lacks histidine.  d) The following are three bacterial mutants that have different mutations in the DNA sequence that encodes the C-terminus of an enzyme (200 amino acids long) that is required for Histidine biosynthesis and that requires Gln197 for its function.

1) Some external development caused the atmosphere to become thin. The thin atmosphere then caused the change in the environment that caused the bodies of water to dry up and the organisms to disappear from the surface. (
2) Organisms on the surface developed some form of metabolism that resulted in a waste product that escaped into the atmosphere and caused it to become thin.  The thin atmosphere then caused the change in the environment that caused the bodies of water to dry up and the organisms to disappear from the surface. NASA scientists describe Titan as an extraordinary world where Earth-like geophysical processesoperate on exotic materials in very alien conditions. Instead of liquid water, there is liquid methane(temperature on Titan is sub -170°C); instead of silicate rocks, there is frozen water ice; instead of dirt, there are hydrocarbon particles; and instead of lava, Titan’s volcanoes spew very cold ice. c)  We have no idea what life on Titan might look like.   However, if we are to find a living organism on Titan, it will have the following three properties:metabolism, controlled/regulated growth, reproduction. d)  Assume that life is found on Titan and that these organisms live in an environment where energy is freely available from abiotic sources.  If in the future, the energy from abiotic sources becomes limiting, what feature would be common in the organisms that would survive and thrive through such a transition? Why? If energy from abiotic sources become limiting, organisms that can produce their own energy would have selective advantage, since they could grow and replicate regardless of the abundance of abiotic energy in the environment. Such organisms, then, would survive and thrive through a transition to the environment with limited sources of energy from abiotic sources. 6

On the figure above, identify each complex. For the bacteria-human hybrid, indicate which strand is bacterial, and which is human. Briefly justify your choices. 3 Question 3 As a UROP student, you are working in bacteria on the metabolism of the monosaccharide, theose. Metabolism of theose requires the enzymes X, Y, and Z.  The genes encoding these enzymes are part of one operon, and the product of gene N (N protein) regulates the transcription of these three genes.  In a normal cell, protein A is always produced.  A diagram of this operon is shown below.

On the figure above, identify each complex. For the bacteria-human hybrid, indicate which strand is bacterial, and which is human. Briefly justify your choices. Human DNA for the same protein is likely to be significantly longer than a bacterial gene encoding homologous bacterial protein because the human gene is likely to have introns.  Those are represented by the large loops in the human-bacterial hybrid in the figure above. Furthermore, because the protein sequence is not 100% identical between the human and bacterial versions, some portions of the human and bacterial genes are likely to not be similar enough to base pair (even with mismatches). Those regions are represented by the small bulges that occur on both the human and bacterial strands in the hybrid figure above. 3Question 3 As a UROP student, you are working in bacteria on the metabolism of the monosaccharide, theose.

However, freezer space in the lab is limited and she can keep only one.  Which cell line should she keep? Red blood cell Gut cell B cell T cell Why keep this cell line rather than the others? She should keep the gut cell line.  Red blood cells do not have nuclei, and B and T cells have rearranged the DNA at the antibody and T cell receptor loci, respectively 2Question 1, continued Part B The virus which causes AIDS (acquired immune deficiency syndrome) is called HIV (human immunodeficiency virus).  HIV is a retrovirus, and its genome is a single RNA strand.  Two copies of this RNA genome are packaged with two copies of the retroviral enzyme, reverse transcriptase, within a protein capsid. a) For HIV infection to occur, a surface protein on the virus must interact with a surface protein on the cell. HIV specifically infects the helper T cells of the human immune system.  Give one reason that HIV infection is specific for helper T cells. A viral protein on the surface of the HIV particle binds to a protein that is only found on helper T cells. b) Once infection has taken place, the RNA genome has to be made into double-stranded DNA.  This process is mediated by reverse transcriptase.  Once a double-stranded DNA copy of the HIV genome has been made, it is integrated into the host cell genome.  The integration event is mediated by an enzyme, integrase.       i) What are the three steps required to produce double-stranded DNA from the single strand RNA genome? 
3.  Synthesis of the complementary strand of DNA using the single strand of DNA as the template to form double-stranded DNA. ii) The central dogma states that: DNA RNA ProteinWhich one of the enzymatic      activities possessed by reverse transcriptase goes against the central dogma?  Explain your answer.      The RNA-directed DNA polymerase activity used to synthesize a single strand of DNA from a single strand     RNA template.  The central dogma states that only DNA can act as the template for DNA synthesis (in replication), and that only DNA acts as the template for RNA synthesis (in transcription). The drug most widely used to combat AIDS is Azidothymidine (AZT).  AZT is very similar to thymidine, except that the 3' hydroxyl (OH) group on the deoxyribose ring has been replaced by an azido (N
1.  Alanine would only interact with van der Waals forces ii) Would Lysine or Glutamic Acid interact more strongly with region 2?   Why? 12 Lysine, it is  (+) charged and can form ionic bonds with region 
2. Glutamic acid is also  (-) charged and would repel. d) You design many proteins that bind tightly in this pocket.  One of them has isoleucine associated with region 
3.  You substitute phenylalanine for isoleucine and find this prevents binding of this protein. Phenylalanine and isoleucine form the same kinds of interactions with the binding pocket, so why can’t the phenylalanine version of the protein bind? Phenylalanine has a large side chain that prevents the substrate from fitting into the pocket. Steric hinderence. Question 4 (19 points) Under standard conditions, the reaction A + B Æ C + D has a positive ∆Go. The reaction C + D Æ A + B has a negative ∆Go. Activation energy C + D ∆Go Activation energy lowered when enzyme added A + B Reacti on Pro gre ss a) On the above energy diagram above, label the following: •  activation energy • ∆Go •  C + D •  A + B c) Modify the above diagram to show how it would change if an enzyme that catalyzed the reaction is added. d) What effect, if any, would this have on the reaction? An enzyme does not change the ∆Go of the reaction, but by lowering the activation energy, it speeds up the reaction C + D ÆA + B. 13 
1) The DNA sequence that defines a promoter is specific to that organism.  A eukaryotic promoter will not be recognized by prokaryotic RNA polymerase, so the eukaryotic gene is not transcribed. 
2) Eukaryotic genes often have introns.  An inton is a region of DNA that deso not encode protein and is spliced out of the transcript prior to translation. Prokaryotic organisms do not have introns and can not remove them from the transcript so the protein produced would not be correct. The genes on the Ti plasmid are expressed in plant cells so they must have eukaryotic promoters. The Ti DNA sequences encode plant hormones, so they likely came originally from a plant. c) d) e) i) ii) PvuII PvuII or any other restriction enzyme that leaves blunt ends.

The E. coli cells that are transformed can be grown on media containing ampicillin. i) ii) Only cells that carry a plasmid will survive. f) You would have or create E. uredovora cells that are missing the crt1 gene (crt1- cells). These cells will not grow on minimal medium.  These crt1- cells can then be transformed with the plasmids from the library, and transformed cells would be grown on minimal media.  Only cells with the wild type crt1 gene will grow. 10 Question 3 2 RA light Pgross 1 P 3 B phytoplankton D 5 B = biomass D = detritus F = feces I = ingestion A = assimilation P = production R = respiration I = A + F A = R + P RH 6 Fish 4 I AP 8 10 Fish Harvest B F 7 D 9 heterotrophic bacteria B RH 11 1 = GPP: gross CO2 fixation 2 = phytoplankton respiration 3 = NPP: net primary production by phytoplankton 4 = phytoplankton eaten by fish 5 = phytoplankton detritus (phytoplankton that die before being eaten) 6 = fish respiration 7 = fish waste (feces) 8 = net production by fish 9 = fish that die without being harvested 10 = fish harvest 11 = respiration by detritivores (bacteria) b) Decrease.

The mutant allele differs from the wild-type allele by a single base-pair (bp) substitution.  This substitution eliminates a NheI restriction site that is present in the wild-type allele.

You then sequence the corresponding region in the mutant PCR product and discover that not only did the mutation eliminate the NheI site in the mutant allele but it has created a new PvuII restriction site.  The recognition sites for the two enzymes are indicated below.   NheI cuts: 	 5' GCTAGC 3' PvuII cuts:  5' CAGCTG 3' 3' CGATCG 5' 3' GTCGAC 5' A portion of one strand of the wild-type DNA sequence is shown below: 5’....GCTAGCTG...3’ What is the sequence of this same region in the mutant allele?  Indicate the 5' and the 3' ends of the DNA sequence. e) Individuals 1 and 2 have another child, 9, who is affected by the genetic condition. 1 5 2 6 9 You PCR amplify the 1000 bp region affected by the mutation from individuals 1, 2, and 9, digest the PCR products with NheI or PvuII, and analyze the restriction fragments on a gel: Individual: 1 NheI  PvuII 2 9NheI  PvuII NheI  PvuII 1000 bp 600 bp 400 bp What event occurred and how does this explain the data shown above? 13 Question 9 Consider the following hypothetical chromosomal region containing two genes, fadA and fadB, necessary for the breakdown of oleic acid in a bacterium. Px fadX P O  /fadAfadBP = Promoter O = Operator The FadX protein, which is continuously produced, binds to the operator in the presence of oleic acid. a) Is the FadX protein a repressor or an activator of the fadA and the fadB genes?  Briefly justify your reasoning. b) For each of the following mutants (m1 - m
5) = 12,500 kg/week b) 	i) This model would predict that 1/2 as much carbon would be fixed by the phytoplankton. Since all efficiencies remain the same, this would cause all flows to decrease to 50% of their non-poisoned levels. This would therefore reduce the detritivore respiration by 50%. This is not consistent with the observed increase. ii) This model would predict that 5 kg carbon per week of fish are dying and therefore becoming detritus. Since all efficiencies are the same and the tank remains at steady state, this additional input to the detritus must be made up for by an equal increase in output from detritus. Since the only output from detritus is respiration (refractory carbon cannot increase at steady state), detritivore respiration must increase by 5 kg carbon per day. This is consistent with your measurement. 14 Question 1, continued c) You would need to exclude the squid from an area of the ocean.  If squid are the keystone species, you would expect to see a decrease in the species diversity of the small fish and invertebrates.

1. Thus you can use the genomic DNA from the the wild- type yeast cells. Based on the information provided you can also  use the  genomic DNA isolated from Strain 2 ( that has mutation in Gene 2 only) and strain 3  (that has mutation in Gene 3 only) since they both have alleles of Gene 1 that encode the wild-type copy of E1 and should therefore be  able to complement the mutation in Strain 1 (arg-) and restore its ability to produce arginine (arg+).   b) You successfully isolate yeast genomic DNA from the yeast strain(s) that you chose in part (a). You   need to choose a plasmid that you could use as a vector to create the yeast genomic library in E. coli and  use this library to transform yeast Strain 1 so that it can now synthesize arginine. List the minimum features that your vector should have to execute this plan. Your plasmid should have both the bacterial and yeast origins of replication so that it can replicate in the bacterial   and yeast cells. It should also have the recognition site(s) for restriction enzyme(s) so that the plasmid can be cutopen and used as a vector to clone the yeast genomic DNA fragments that have either been digested with the same  restriction enzyme(s) or a different one(s) that generates complementary ends. The plasmid should also have a  selection marker such as the tetracycline resistance gene (tetr) that can be used to distinguish the host cells that  have been transformed with the recombinant plasmid that has the yeast genomic DNA insert, from the remaining   host cell population. Note: There is no need for your plasmid to have a promoter since the gene by definition is thepromoter + the transcribed region or in other words the gene comes with its own inherent promoter.   c) You generate a restriction map of the plasmid that you want to use as a cloning vector. You cut theplasmid with the following combination of the restriction enzymes and determine the size of the resulting DNA fragments by DNA gel electrophoresis. The size of the DNA fragments after digestion by restriction enzymes X, Y and Z is tabulated below (kb = kilo base pairs; 1kb= 1000bp). Please note that      AmpR and KanR represent the ampicillin and kanamycin resistant genes that are a part of the plasmid vector.

2. You will then replica plate the colonies from Plate 2 (or Plate 
3. So the colonies that grew on plate 2 but not on plate 3 will be the colonies of your interest.   f) You successfully create a yeast genomic library in E. coli cells.  How can you use this library to clone-by- function the gene that can restore the ability of Strain 1 to produce arginine. You isolate the recombinant plasmid from the transformed bactreial cells, tranform the yeast Styrain 1 with the recombinant  plasmid  and  see  if  they  grow  and  form  colonies  on  the  minimal  media  that  lacks  arginine.  The recombinant plasmid that has a wild- type copy of Gene 1 can rescue the arginine producing ability of Strain 
1. Therefore if you score 320 mice you would expect 320/16 = 20 mice to have large and active phenotype.     c) You find that the two genes are linked. If the map distance between the two genes is20 cM, out of a total of 400 offspring, how many will show the non-recombinant/parental phenotypes?  A map distance of 20cM corresponds to 20% recombinants and 80% non-recombinants /   parental progeny. Hence, out of a total of 400, you would expect 320 to show the parentalphenotype i.e. 160 will be large and lethargic with a genotype of dGdg and the other 160 will be small and active with a genotype of Dgdg.    Question 4   Your next experiment involves the fruit fly.  In the parental (P) generation, you mate a  true-breeding female fly that has short antennae and red eyes with a true-breeding   male fly that has long antennae and white eyes.  All of the flies in the F1 generation have  long antennae and red eyes.   Note: Assume the genes for these two traits are located on autosomes.  For the alleles that regulate antennae  length, use the letters “A” and “a” and for the alleles that regulate eye color, use the letters “B” and “b.”  Use the uppercase letters to represent the alleles associated with dominant phenotypes and lowercase letters  to represent the alleles associated with recessive phenotypes.  a) Give the genotypes of the flies in the P generation.

Is this more   likely to be an error in mitosis or in meiosis?

Does this disorder most likely reflect an error that occurred during a mitotic cell division or during a meiotic celldivision? Explain briefly.

1.  You have isolated a set of five yeast mutants that form dark red colonies instead of the usual white colonies of wild-type yeast.

(b) Next you cross each haploid mutant strain to a different haploid mutant of the opposite mating type.

2. In this problem we will explore some of the many ways that mutations in two different genes can interact to produce different Mendelian ratios.  Consider a hypothetical insect species that has red eyes.  Imagine mutations in two different unlinked genes that can, in certain combinations, block the formation of red eye pigment yielding mutants with white eyes.  In principle, there are two different possible arrangements for two biochemical steps responsible for the formation of red eye pigment.  The two genes might act in seriessuch that a mutation in eithergene would block the formation of red pigment.  Alternatively, the two genes could act in parallelsuch that mutations in bothgenes would be required to block the formation of red pigment. Series Parallel Gene 1 Gene 2 red pigment Gene 1 Gene 2 red pigment Further  complexity arises from the possibility that mutations in either gene that lead to a block in enzymatic activity could be either dominant or recessive. a)  Such considerations yield the following six possibilities: 
3)  Pathways in series with dominant mutations in both genes. 
4)  Pathways in parallel with recessive mutations in both genes. 
5)  Pathways in parallel with a recessive mutation in one gene and a dominant mutation in the other.
6)  Pathways in parallel with dominant mutations in both genes.First let’s consider the possible outcomes from these possibilities in crosses between a wild type insect with red eyes and a true breeding white eyed strain with mutations in both genes. For each of the six possible cases outlined above, determine the phenotype of the F1 progeny (either red or white eyes) and the expected phenotypic ratio of red to white eyed insects in the F
7)  a recessive mutation in a single gene, or 
8) a dominant mutation in a single gene.  Use the table below of chi-squared probabilities for any statistical tests. pvalue: df = 1 df = 2 df = 3 .995 .000 .01 .07 .975 .000 .05 .22 
1.   a.  Crossing each yeast haploid mutant to wild-type will tell you whether the mutation is recessive or dominant to wild-type.  If the diploid is wild-type phenotype, then the mutation is recessive to wild-type.  If the diploid is mutant phenotype, then the mutation is dominant to wild-type.  Therefore, mutants 1, 2, 3 and 5 are recessive to wild-type and mutant 4 is dominant to wild-type.   b.  These crosses are actually complementation tests, allowing us to determine whether the two mutants crossed have mutations in the same gene or in different genes.  Mutants that do not complement each other (progeny have mutant phenotype) are said to be in the same complementation group and therefore in the same gene.  Based on non-complementation of the recessive mutations, we can conclude that mutants 1 and 3 form one complementation group and are mutations in the same gene (gene A).  Likewise, we can conclude that mutations 2 and 5 form a second complementation group and are mutations in a second gene (gene B).  We are unable to determine whether mutant 4 represents a mutation in a new gene or a mutation in one of the other two genes because it is a dominant mutation.

1.  Consider a portion of an autosome in Drosophila, which carries the following three recessive markers: black body (b–), purple eyes (pr–), and vestigial wings (vg–).  The corresponding wild type alleles of each gene are designated b+, pr+, and vg+.  A genetic map of this portion of the chromosome is shown below: vg pr b 6 cM 13 cM The measured two-factor distance between b and pr is 6 cM, and the distance between pr and vg is 13 cM. (a) Imagine that you want to set up a cross to verify these map distances and you have in the lab a true-breeding strain with black body and vestigial wings.  What type of true breeding fly would you want to mate to in order to carry out a three-factor cross with b, pr, and vg? (b)  For the cross described in (a) what type of strain would be the best to mate to in order to score the gamete genotypes passed to the next generation? (c) What would be the rarest phenotypic class(es) produced from the cross in part (b)? (d) Write out the eight possible genotypes produced in the cross described in part (b).  If 1,000 progeny are produced in this cross, how many of each type would you expect? (e)  What would you expect the measured distance between b and vg to be in a two-factor cross between these markers?  Explain why this distance is less than the sum of the b–pr and pr–vg distances (i.e. 19 cM)? 
2. You have isolated two different yeast mutants that will not grow on medium that lacks arginine.  You call these mutants arg1– and arg2–. a)  Mating of either arg1– or arg2– to wild type produces diploids that can grow without arginine.  Mating of arg1– to arg2–  produces a diploid that also can grow on medium without arginine.  What do these results tell you about the arg1– and arg2– mutations? b) Sporulation of the diploids produced by the mating of arg1– to arg2–  yields tetrads of the following types: type 1 1 Arg+, 3 Arg– type 2 4 Arg– Out of 20 tetrads,  2 are type 1, and 18 are type 
3.  Categorize each of the tetrad types as parental ditype (P), tetratype (T), or nonparental ditype (N).  What does this result tell you about the relationship between arg3– and arg1–?  Give any relevant distances in cM. e) Based on these results deduce the relationship between arg3– and arg2–.  In a mating of arg3– to arg2–  what would the phenotype of the resulting diploid be?  If this diploid were sporulated and 60 tetrads were examined how many tetrads of each type would you expect? .

1.  (a) The three stop codons are 5’UAG3’, 5’UAA3’, and 5’UGA3’.  Explain why mutagens that specifically induce G•C to A•T mutations will generally produce TAG (amber) and TGA nonsense mutations more frequently than TAA (ochre) mutations. (b) You are trying to isolate tRNA mutations that will suppress and amber (TAG) mutation. To increase the frequency of such mutations you use a mutagen that produces transition mutations (i.e. C•G to T•A and T•A to C•G base changes).  Which tRNA genes could in principle be altered by the mutagen to give the desired suppressor mutation? For your answer give the sequence of the codon normally recognized by the tRNA. In addition, write out the DNA base sequence of the segment of the tRNA gene that codes for the anticodon sequence for both the wild-type and suppressor alleles of the gene. Please show both strands of the DNA and indicate the 5’ and 3’ ends of each strand indicating which strand is used as the template for transcription of the tRNA molecule.

The diagram below shows the F factor and a portion of the E. colichromosome that has three different insertion sequences (IS) of the same type as is carried on F. ori T IS A IS B CIS ISDFigure by MIT OCW. (a) Draw a diagram of the three different Hfrs that can be formed by recombination between the IS on F and each of the IS sequences on the chromosome.  For your answer, include the positions of each of the markers (A, B, C, and D) and state which of these markers would be transferred early. (You will need to take into account the orientation of the IS and origin of transfer (ori T) on F as well as the orientations of the different IS sequences in the chromosome.) (b) For each to the three Hfrs in part (a) consider the outcome of further crossovers between IS sequences flanking the integrated F factor (there should be five different relevant IS by IS recombinations for each of the three Hfrs).  For each possible recombination events state whether the product is F, an F’ or an Hfr.  Also provide information about which markers will be transferred on the F’s and which markers will be transferred early by the Hfrs.

1. (a) You have isolated two mutations in the Lac operon that cause constitutive expression of Lac genes.  You designate these mutants Lac1– and Lac2–.  Making use of an F' that carries the Lac operon with the LacY gene mutated, you construct strains that you test for both ß-galactosidase activity and Lac permease activity with results shown below.

Finally, deduce what type of Lac mutation best fits the properties of Lac 1– and of Lac 2–. (b) The first Lac promoter mutations that were isolated were “leaky” mutations that decreased, but did not entirely eliminate, the promoter function.

Explain how the results shown above would lead to such a conclusion. (c)  You have isolated two mutations that show decreased expression of the Lac operon. However, unlike like the promoter mutations described in part (b) these mutations don’t respond to the inducer IPTG. These mutations, designated Lac3– and Lac4–, are evaluated for the quantity of ß-galactosidase and permease activity expressed with or without IPTG: ß-galactosidase activity – IPTG + IPTG Lac permease activity – IPTG + IPTG Lac 3–Lac 3– / F' Lac I+LacZ –Lac 4–Lac 4– / F' Lac I+LacZ – 12 1 8 8 1212 88 12na 9 na 12  na  9  na (na = not assayed) Mapping experiments reveal that Lac3– and Lac4– are different short deletions located in the region before the start of the LacZ gene. Given the data shown above suggest which genetic element(s) in addition to part of the promoter has been deleted in each mutant. Explain your reasoning. 
2. You are studying a new strain of E. colithat can utilize the disaccharide melibiose very efficiently.  You find that utilization depends on the enzyme melibiase, which is encoded by the gene Mel
1.  We know that MelB- is recessive because MelB-/F’ Mel+ results in regulated melibiose activity, rather than uninducible.  Mel1- is also a recessive mutation using the same reasoning as with MelB-.  With two recessive mutation, a complementation test is then performed (MelB-/F’ Mel1-).  The result is that MelB- and Mel1- complement each other, meaning that they are mutations in different genes.  This strain (MelB-/F’ Mel1-) also allow us to deduce that MelB’s wild-type gene product is trans-acting because we observe regulated activity when wild-type MelB is placed in trans with wild-type Mel
1. You are studying regulation of the yeast enzyme glutamine synthetase (GS), which is encoded by the GLN1 gene.  You have isolated two mutants, designated gln2– and gln3–, that give decreased GS activity.  Mating of either gln2– or gln3– haploids to wild type produces heterozygous diploids that show normal amounts of GS expression. When you cross either a gln2– or gln3– haploid to a gln1– strain the resulting diploids show normal expression of GS. (a) From these experiments classify the gln2– and gln3– mutations in terms of their basic genetic properties explaining the rationale behind your conclusions.  Based on these properties make a proposal for the types of regulatory functions affected by the gln2– and gln3– mutations. (b) Diagram two different linear models and one parallel model that could explain the effect of the gln2– and gln3– mutations on the regulation of GLN
2.  You obtain 6 BACs (of known order, as shown below) and 7 STSs (of unknown order) that derive from a region of mouse chromosome 16 whose genomic sequence has not yet been finished. A B C D E F By PCR (using 20-bp primers at either end of each STS), you test each of the 6 BACs for thepresence (+) or absence (-) of each of the 7 STSs.  You obtain the following results: BACs 1 + + + -+ + A B C D E F 2 -+ + + --3 + -----STSs 4 --+ + + -5 -+ + + + + 6 -----+ 7 + + ----(a) Construct a physical map of this region that shows the order of the STSs, and the placement of the STSs within the BACs.  (Hint: Consider the possibility that one or two of the STSs are present twice in the region spanned by the 6 BACs.)  Are there any ambiguities within your map? If so, describe them. (b) You determine the DNA sequences of PCR products obtained at STS5 using BACs B, C, D, E, and F as PCR templates.  The DNA sequences of PCR products obtained using BACs B and C are identical, but they differ by several nucleotide substitutions from the DNA sequences of PCR products obtained using BACs E and F.  Oddly, PCR product obtained using BAC D appears to be a mixture of two sequences – one corresponding to the BAC B/ BAC C sequence and the other corresponding to the BAC E/ BAC F sequence.  Briefly account for these findings, and explain how a single PCR assay could amplify two different sequences. (c) Do the findings presented in part (b) confirm, refine, or refute your answers to part (a)?  Briefly explain your answer. (d) Would you expect the DNA sequence of PCR product obtained at STS5 using mouse genomic DNA as template to more closely resemble that obtained using BAC B, BAC D, or BAC F?  Briefly explain your answer. 3  of  4 (e) Is there a second STS at which you would like to sequence PCR products obtained using BACs as templates?  If so, which BACs would you test in this way, and what sequencing results might you predict for each of the BACs tested? (f) How would you use the sequence information presented in part (b) to design two new STSs (with new PCR primer pairs) to replace STS5?  (Call the new ones STS51 and STS
3.  Many mouse genes are “tissue-specific,” that is, they are present throughout the body but are expressed in only one of the animal’s many tissue types.  (Other mouse genes are expressed throughout the body, or in multiple tissues.)  Geneticists can study the regulation of a mouse gene by fusing the gene’s promoter region to the LacZ coding sequence and injecting the construct to create a transgenic mouse.  Fusion of the mouse amylase promoter to LacZ yielded a Pamylase-LacZ construct. (a)  Would microinjection of the Pamylase-LacZ construct into the male pronucleus of a fertilized egg likely result in integration of the construct into the amylase gene?  Briefly explain your answer. (b)  Mice heterozygous for the resulting Pamylase-LacZ transgene displayed LacZ expression exclusively in the pancreas.  Would you expect homozygotes for the transgene to also display LacZ expression in the pancreas?  Elsewhere?  Briefly explain your answer. (c)  You are surprised to observe that mice homozygous for the transgene insertion display a serious heart defect.  (Heterozygotes have normal hearts.)  Suggest a possible explanation. (d)  Propose an experimental test of your hypothesis from part (c) using gene targeting in mice. Draw a labeled diagram of the targeting construct that you would use, and outline any breeding experiments required to test your hypothesis. (e)  Propose how you might use LacZ in a gene targeting experiment in mice to test whether the amylase gene is expressed exclusively in the pancreas. Draw a labeled diagram of the targeting construct that you would use, and outline any breeding experiments required to test your hypothesis. 4  of  4 
1. a) Genetic properties of gln2- and gln 3-:Both are uninducible, as they give decreased glutamine synthetase (GS) activity.Both are recessive, as mating them with wildtype produces normal GS activity.Both are trans-acting, as when either mutation is crossed to gln1-, complementation takes place;if either gln2- or gln3- were a cis-acting element regulator of gln1, we would not see complementation, as the two mutations would be in the same gene. (i.e. the promoter is considered to be part of the gene it acts on.)  Since we see complementation in both cases, we know that both mutations must be trans-acting. Therefore both gln2- and gln3- are mutations in genes for positive regulators. b) Linear models: gln2‡gln3‡gln1 gln3‡gln2‡gln1 Parallel model: gln2gln3  gln1 c) The parallel model from part b) best fits the experimental results, as we are told that the addition of glutamate (glu) and glutamine (gln) independently regulate the GS activity (i.e. the results of the addition of each is different from the addition of both). glu---| gln2gln---| gln3  gln1 d)We would expect the gln2-gln3- double mutant to be uninducible. e) The cis-acting elements in the promoter are: •	 Deletion1 (-300 to –
2. a)	 We can use the information from the order of the BACs to figure out where each STS is. For instance, BAC A is positive for STS 3, which is not present in any other BAC; therefore it must be in the region of A that does not overlap with B or C.  There are three ambiguities in the data, resulting in three possible maps.  Most of the ambiguity lies in whether BAC D contains both STS 51 and STS 52, as PCR only provides the qualitative answer that STS 5 is present; we don’t get quantitative data as to how many versions of STS5 are present on the BAC.  Case1 displays the possibility that BAC D contains both STS5s.  Given this case, we cannot determine the order of STS51 and STS 2 (thus the parenthesis).  Case 2 displays the possibility that STS51 is not on BAC D.  If this assumption is true, then we can determine the order of STS51 and STS
1. In humans, albinism (unpigmented skin, hair, and eyes) is due to an enzymatic deficiency, and it is an autosomal recessive trait.  Suppose that in a small country of one million people (“Generation 1”), there are 500 aaalbinos and 9000 Aaheterozygous carriers. (a) Estimate q, the frequency of allele a, in Generation 
2. Consider a heritable autosomal disease with an incidence in the population of 1 per thousand.  On average, individuals with the disease have 80% as many children as the population average. In answering the various parts of this question, assume that mating is random.  State any additional simplifying assumptions that you employ, and show your calculations. 2 (a) What mutation rate would be required to maintain the observed incidence of the disease in the population if the disease is dominant? (b) What mutation rate would be required to maintain the observed incidence of the disease in the population if the disease is recessive? (c) Now assume that the mutation rate is zero, that the disease is recessive, and that the disease allele is maintained in the population by heterozygote advantage.  Calculate the heterozygote advantage, and restate its meaning in biological terms. 
1. You are conducting genetic linkage studies of an autosomal dominant disease.  You are focused on two SSR markers that may be linked to each other and to the disease.  Here is a family in which some individuals are affected: Family 1  SSR62 SSR93A B C A B C  AB C  AB C Calculate LOD scores for linkage at θ = 
2) selectively return “unaffected” embryos to the woman’s uterus? Briefly explain or illustrate your answer. (d) The cystic fibrosis gene is located on human chromosome 
1. (a) Let's denote the disease allele as - and the wild-type allele as +. The "grandfather's" genotype (top row) at the disease locus must be +/-, since not all of his offspring (the "parents") are affected by the autosomal dominant disease. Therefore, all of the affected individuals on this pedigree are heterozygous (+/-) at the disease locus. We can determine the phase relationship between the disease and SSR62 in each of the affected parents (second row) by looking at the genotypes of the grandparental generation and determining what alleles each grandparent passed on to affected parent. At SSR62, the affected mother received allele B from the unaffected grandmother. She also received a + at the disease locus from the grandmother, whose genotype at the disease locus is +/+. Therefore, the affected mother must have received the rest of her alleles, SSR62 A and the disease allele -, together from the affected grandfather. So we know the phase relationship in the affected mother looks like the following:  SSR62 A Disease -___ B +___ Similarly, the phase in the affected father can also be found by looking at what alleles he received from the grandparental generation. The phase in the affected father looks like the following: SSR62 A Disease -___ C +___ Now we look at the offspring generation (bottom row). In all cases, SSR62 A is in phase with -, the disease allele. In the four offspring on the left side, the three affected offspring received SSR62 A and - from the affected mother. These three belong to the parental (non-crossover) class. But the unaffected daughter received SSR62 A and + from the affected mother, which only could have happened if there were a crossover event between the SSR62 locus and disease locus. Therefore, she belongs to the recombinant (crossover) class. On the right, the affected father gave his two affected sons SSR62 A and -, and gave SSR62 C and + to his two unaffected children, so all four children on the right are in the parental class. Among the eight offspring, there are seven parentals and one recombinant, so the LOD score calculation looks like the following: LOD θ=
1. You are studying three autosomal recessive mutations in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster.  Flies that are homozygous for the hb– mutation are “humpbacked” (wild-type flies are straight-backed).  Flies that are homozygous for the bl– mutation are “blistery-winged” (wild-type flies are smooth-winged).  Flies that are homozygous for the st– mutation are “stubby-legged” (wild-type flies are long-legged).    You mate flies from two true-breeding strains, and the resulting F1 flies are all are straight-backed, smooth-winged, and long-legged.  F1 females are then mated to males that are humpbacked, blistery-winged, and stubby-legged.  In the F2 generation, among 1000 progeny resulting from this cross, you observe the following phenotypes:     humpbacked, blistery-winged, and stubby-legged (26 flies) Phenotype       Number     humpbacked, blistery-winged, and long-legged  (455 flies) humpbacked, smooth-winged, and long-legged  (24 flies) straight-backed, blistery-winged, and stubby-legged (27 flies) straight-backed, blistery-winged, and long-legged (4 flies) straight-backed, smooth-winged, and stubby-legged (442 flies) straight-backed, smooth-winged, and long-legged (22 flies)   (a, 6 pts.) The male flies that were bred to the F1 generation in order to produce the F2 generation were humpbacked, blistery-winged, and stubby-legged.  On each of their chromosomes, they have the alleles hb– bl– st–.

The mutant trait indicated by the dots is dominant, whereas the mutant trait indicated by the stripes is recessive.  Assume 100% penetrance and no new mutations.   (Squares = males, circles = females.)               (a, 6 pts.) Assuming that both mutant traits are due to linked autosomal genes that are 6 cM apart, fill in the following chart using the allele notation indicated by the key above.

3.  You are working with a mutant strain of yeast that is dark tan (wild-type yeast are white).  The “dark tan” phenotype of the haploid cells you are working with is caused by two different mutations in the same strain.  The two mutations are designated drk1– and drk2–.     (a, 6 pts.) Mating of the drk1– drk2– double mutant to wild-type yeast produces diploids that are white.  Sporulation of these diploids yields 50 tetrads.  4 of these tetrads (called “Type One”) contain four light tan spores.  37 of these tetrads (called “Type Two”) contain two dark tan spores and two white spores. 9 of these tetrads (called “Type Three”) contain one dark tan spore, two light tan spores, and one white spore. Categorize each of the tetrad types as parental ditype (PD), tetratype (TT), or nonparental ditype (NPD).         (b, 6 pts.) Are the drk1– and drk2– mutations linked?  If so, give the distance between them. (Label your answer with the proper units.)          (c, 6 pts.) In yeast, 1 cM of genetic distance corresponds to 3,500 base pairs of physical distance.  An average yeast gene is about 1,400 base pairs long, and the longest yeast gene is 14,700 base pairs.  Keeping this information in mind, you select a “Type Three” tetrad from part (a) and mate the two light tan spores from that tetrad to each other.  Can you deduce the color of the resulting diploids?  If so, what color would the diploids be?     7Name: ____________________________________        Next you isolate a mutant strain of yeast that cannot grow on medium lacking leucine.  This strain contains a single mutation you call leu1–.  The leu1– mutation is near to drk1– on the same chromosome.  When the leu1– mutant is mated to wild-type yeast, the resulting diploids cannot grow on medium lacking leucine.    (d, 9 pts.) You mate leu1– yeast to drk1– yeast and sporulate the resulting diploid.  You grow the resulting spores on medium containing leucine.  You then test for growth on medium lacking leucine.  It is apparent that you have isolated only two types of tetrads, 10 tetrads of Type A and 10 tetrads of Type B.  On medium lacking leucine, only two spores from each Type A tetrad can grow; both are light tan in color.  Complete the chart below so as to indicate:  How many spores from each Type B tetrad can grow on medium lacking leucine, and what color is each spore that can grow?         Type A tetrad   Type B tetrad  # of spores that can grow on medium lacking leucine 2       color of each spore that can grow on medium lacking leucine  both are light tan     (e, 8 pts.)

2. You are studying the regulation of a bacterial gene called nytT, which is expressed only when the bacterial strain is grown in the dark.  You isolate two mutations, nytA1– and nytB1–, which affect the regulation of nytT.

The transposon insertion in this strain is linked to the nytT locus with a cotransduction frequency of 85%, and this insertion does not alter normal nytT regulation.  You use the resulting lysate to infect a nytA1– strain, and select for tetracycline resistance.  None of the 30 Tetr cotransductants you examine express the nytT gene under any conditions.  You obtain the same results when you use the same P1 lysate to infect a nytB1–  recipient strain.  (a, 5 pts) Can you conclude if nytA1– is constitutive or uninducible?  If so, state whether nytA1– is constitutive or uninducible, and state what was the most important piece of information (for example, which strain in the table) you used to reach your conclusion.

If so, state whether nytA1– is dominant or recessive, and state what was the most important piece of information (for example, which strain in the table) you used to reach your conclusion.                           Name: ___________________________ (c, 8 pts) Can you conclude if nytA1– acts in cis or in trans with respect to nytT?

(Please diagram only linear pathways in which each gene is controlled by no more than one regulator.  Please do not include any steps that invoke unknown players.)  For each model, include only the following: wild-type nytA, nytB, and nytT, and “bright light.”                    5                  Name: ___________________________

4. You are studying a strain of E. coli whose total genome size is 4,639 kilobase pairs (kbp).

2.  You are studying regulation of the Wrm1 gene, a yeast gene that is expressed in response to heat.  You isolate a wrm1::lacZ strain that expresses β-galactosidase when Wrm1 is normally expressed (which is at 36°C but not at 24°C).  You use this wrm1::lacZ strain to perform a genetic screen looking for mutants that do not properly regulate expression of Wrm

4.  The scenario on the next page asks a biological question that can be addressed by creating genetically engineered mice.  When creating engineered mice, the following 8 steps need to be considered.  For each mouse you make in this problem, please state:          i)  whether you are using pronuclear injection or gene targeting techniques            ii)  what DNA you would introduce into the mouse cells (also draw the DNA)          iii)  whether you would put the DNA into a fertilized egg or ES cells          iv) from what genotype of mouse would you get the fertilized egg or ES cells          v)  where in the mouse genome the DNA you introduced would integrate          vi)  whether creating the mouse should involve the generation of a chimera or not          vii) which additional breeding steps you would do to make the mouse you wanted          viii) two possible phenotypic results you could get from the newly made mice, and            the corresponding conclusions you would make based on each result 8  (15 pts)  “Non-homologous end joining” is the process by which a DNA sequence gets inserted into a chromosomal region to which it is not homologous. Having a functional copy of the gene “NheJ” is necessary for this process to occur in mice. A mouse with no copies of the NheJ gene is sensitive to irradiation as an adult, but a heterozygote is not sensitive.   You decide to test whether one copy of the Drosophila  “d-Nhe” gene could fully compensate for the absence of the mouse NheJ gene.  You have wild-type homozygous mice (NheJ+/NheJ+), heterozygous mice (NheJ+/NheJ–), and homozygous mutant mice (NheJ–/NheJ–) readily available to you.                                9

2) What are the differences between primary cells and cell lines?  What are the advantages and disadvantages of each? Question 3a) There are a set of enzymes called phospholipases, which cleave phospholipids at specific bonds.  What are some of their in vivo functions? 3b) Describe an experiment in which phospholipases can be used as analytical tools to determine if a specific phospholipid is asymmetrically distributed in the two leaflets of the plasma membrane. 3c) What are some examples of phospholipids that are asymmetrically localized? 3d) What are reasons for this asymmetry? Question 4a)Your lab has produced a mouse which is a knockout for the LNO gene. This gene is a known receptor for the SVU growth factor. This is an important receptor during development and loss of this gene causes embryonic lethality in your mouse. The embryos do survive for 14 days in utero.  In order to study the loss of this gene, you decide to create a cell line from the mouse embryos. How would you do this? 4b)You want to determine the specific binding of the SVU to the LNO receptor to find the Kd of the receptor and the number of receptors per cell. How would you do this? What would be your controls? 4c)Surprisingly, you get similar binding curves for cell lines expressing the LNO receptor and the cell line from your knockout mouse. You are worried your mouse was not really a protein null! How could you test for presence of the LNO receptor in the knockout cell line? 4d) Results from the previous experiment show that there is no expression of the LNO receptor in your cell line and you conclude there must be another receptor that binds the SVU ligand. How could you identify this receptor? 4e)You find one novel receptor LOCI also binds the SVU growth factor. You want to perform a binding assay but do not have a similar cell line which does not express this receptor. How would you perform this binding assay? 4f) You find the Kd of the LOCI receptor is 1 x10-
1.  You are studying the cell division cycle of a mammalian cell line grown in culture. Your goal is to determine how long cells spend in each part of the cell cycle. The culture is not synchronized: each cell in the culture is going through a cell cycle independent of the other cells. Therefore, at any point in time, a range of cell cycle states is present.  You pulse the cells for 30 minutes with BrdU, wash it out, and then add an excess of cold thymidine (in what is called a pulse-chase experiment). Following the Pulse-Chase treatment, you remove an aliquot of cells every hour and perform the following types of analysis.   Analysis 1: First you count the number of cells in each aliquot and calculate the total number cells in the culture flask at various times. Your results are shown in figure

Your baymate in the Nurse lab, a sincere but somewhat dim-witted grad student, has obtained a DNA-damage checkpoint mutant in a screen for mutants that are hyper-sensitive to γ-irradiation.  The mutant progresses through the cell cycle in a wild-type manner in the absence of DNA-damage agents.  He suspects that the mutant has a problem in activating the chk1 and chk2 kinases known to be involved in propagating the DNA-damage response.  However, he finds that both kinases are able to be activated to a wild-type level in the presence of γ-irradiation.  Completely stumped, he asks you for your help.  You hypothesize that in this mutant, cdc25 may be unresponsive to the DNA-damage checkpoint activation.  How can you test your hypothesis?  Give two experiments you could do and the expected results.    Question 
1. You have obtained immortalized liver cells from a patient who died of Wilson’s disease, an inherited disorder of copper metabolism marked by neuronal degeneration and hepatic cirrhosis. The Wilson protein is a copper-transporting P-type ATPase that localizes to the trans Golgi network. People with this disease have a mutant (and thus misfolded) version of this copper transporter in the ER.  A) It is unclear if this mutant protein is non-functional or if this mutant triggers the unfolded protein response. Design an experiment that could determine this.         B) There are several chaperone proteins in the ER. You would like to know if BiP binds the Wilson protein. You find that you can isolate some Wilson protein bound to BiP when ADP is added to the cell extracts but not when ATP is added to the extract. Explain this result based on the mechanism for BiP binding substrate proteins.       C) You over express a mutant form of IRE-1 that does not bind BiP. Would this make the Wilson phenotype (i.e. the degradation of Wilson protein) more severe or less severe? Explain your reasoning.        D) You discover that if the transcription factor Hac1 is not activated, the Wilson protein will be transported to its proper location and function normally. Considering the mechanism of Hac1 activation, describe two ways you could inhibit Hac1’s function.  
2. You are studying the EGFR signaling pathway in a tumor cell line isolated from a melanoma. These cells have uncontrolled proliferation. They continue to grow in the absence of EGF or any other growth factor. Another group determined this was due to constitutive activation of the Ras-MAP kinases pathway.  A) You compare the levels of EGFR to wild type cells and see no difference. How would you experimentally compare EGFR levels? What could account for this difference in proliferation but not in overall receptor protein levels?        B) You hypothesize that the Raf kinase may be constitutively active. You are given purified MEK protein. How could you test the state of kinase activation in these cells?        C) You find that the Raf kinase is not constitutively active. What was necessary in the previous assay to show any Raf kinase activity?        D) You hypothesize that either Ras or MAK kinase must be constitutively active. Design experiments to prove which hypothesis is correct.            
3. You are studying the secretory pathway in budding yeast using a combination of genetic, biochemical and cell biological techniques.  a)  You are interested in performing a screen for temperature sensitive secretory mutants in budding yeast.  What property of cells blocked in the secretory system will you exploit in this screen?  How will you use this property to isolate mutants?       b)  You isolate 5 classes of mutants in this screen.  These classes are listed below, along with the location where proteins accumulate.   Describe what function is defective in each class, and briefly explain your answer.   a.  Class A – Cytoplasm                       b.  Class B – Endoplasmic Reticulum   c.  Class C – ER to Golgi Vessicles  d.  Class D – Golgi  e.  Class E – Secretory Vessicles c)  What protein might be mutated in Class A mutants?  What protein might be mutated in Class B mutants?        d)  You isolate a mutant in which proteins that are normally targeted to the endosome instead accumulate in the Golgi.  What protein might defective in these mutants?  What other process might also be affected in these mutants?           e)  An in vitro assay to reconstitute transport processes was discussed in class.  Briefly describe how this assay works.         f)  You are using this system to study retrograde transport.  Give an example of a protein that must be included in order to reconstitute retrograde transport.       
4. You are studying a novel signal transduction cascade in mammalian tissue culture.  Addition of a small molecule ligand called ligand x. to tissue culture cells causes cells to transcriptionally up-regulate a set of genes.  You want to identify the transcription factor involved in this response.  a)  How might you use these genes to identify a possible binding site for your unknown transcription factor?          transcription factor?              b)  You have identified a potential binding site for your unknown transcription factor, which you call LXRE (Ligand X Responsive Element).How would you use a reporter gene to determine which bases LXRE are required for its function?         c)  How can you use the identification of LXRE to identify the unknown   d)  Describe an in vitro assay that you could use to show that your newly identified transcription factor can bind to wild type LXRE, but not mutant LXRE. 
5. Inspired by Monty Kriger’s lecture on cholesterol, LDL, and the LDL receptors, you decide to apply for a UROP in his lab.    a)  To succeed in Monty’s lab, you have to be (very) familiar with receptor-mediated endocytosis of LDL. Please describe briefly the steps of this process. b)  For each of the steps above, describe the phenotype of a hepatocyte (liver cell) that is for some reason unable to execute that step.  Justify your descriptions.                         c)  According to the textbook, the amount of an LDL receptor on the cell surface is what limits the rate of LDL internalization. •  Explain this statement.   •  What other possible factors (i.e. enzymes, processes) could also be limiting the rate of LDL internalization?    •  How would you show whether each of the factors you named above is limiting or not? d)  Receptors for some ligands are degraded after internalization, while receptors for other ligands are recycled to the cell surface. How would you determine whether the receptor for LDL is recycled or degraded after being internalized? 
6. What are the roles of the following in the glycolytic pathway: •  Dolichol  •  Oligosaccharyl transferase  •  Tunicamycin  •  Calnexin/Calreticulin      b)  CD62E is a transmembrane glycoprotein made by cells lining the inside of blood vessels.  •  What point mutation would abolish the glycosylation sites of this protein while minimally affecting the rest of its folding properties?    •  Please describe the likely fate of such a mutated version of CD62E.   •  Does your answer change if these mutations are seen in a cell defective in calnexin/calreticulin? Why or why not?     c)  CD62E binds to the sialyl-LewisX, a carbohydrate expressed on neutrophils. These are white blood cells that are one of the first ones to respond to pathogen-induced inflammation. Neutrophils, which normally circulate in the bloodstream, must slow down and stop in blood vessels closest to the site of inflammation, and then squeezing out of the blood vessels altogether in order to approach and engulf the invading pathogens.  •  Using this information, hypothesize as to the function of CD62E in the immune response.     •  Given the localization of this protein, do you think its surface expression is constitutive or induced? Why?      d)  What are some other functions of oligosaccharide modifications? 
1.  Answer the following questions about actin and microfilaments.  (a) What happens (net growth, net shrinkage, or no net change) to filament length when microfilaments are incubated at each of the following concentrations of monomer?  …a monomer concentration equal to the Cc for the (–) end?   …a monomer concentration equal to the Cc for the (+) end?   …a monomer concentration equal to the Cc for the filament?   (b) What happens (net growth, net shrinkage, or no net change) at each end when microfilaments are incubated at each of the following concentrations of monomer?   …a monomer concentration equal to the Cc for the (–) end?          …a monomer concentration equal to the Cc for the (+) end?   …a monomer concentration equal to the Cc for the filament?     (c) Cytochalasin D and latrunculin both lead to the destabilization of microfilaments. However cytochalasin D binds to F-actin and latrunculin binds to G-actin. Explain how this difference in mechanism can still lead to the same effect.         PLUS       MINUS   (d) How can you demonstrate experimentally that ATP hydrolysis by actin is not necessary for a subunit to add on to a microfilament?           (e) Why is it, if the concentration of ATP is much higher in the cell than ADP and the ATP-bound form of actin is more likely to polymerize, that not all the actin in the cell is polymerized?           Question 
2.   Embryonic epithelial cells grown in rich culture medium appear round and symmetrical. Moving the cells to nutrient-poor medium will cause the cells to differentiate and become polarized.  (a) When you move embryonic epithelial cells to nutrient-poor medium in the presence of cytochalasin D, you find that the cells remain round and symmetrical. What can you conclude from these results?           (b) You wish to visualize the organization of actin in polarized epithelial cells. How could you visualize actin?           (c) Microvilli are cellular projections located on the apical surface of some epithelial cells (such as intestinal epithelial cells) that increase surface area. They contain a core of actin filaments arranged in bundles. You suspect that these bundles are maintained by actin-bundling proteins. Actin-bundling proteins are one of the many kinds of actin-binding proteins we learned about in class. In general, how might you isolate and identify actin-binding proteins?            (d) Once you have identified actin-binding proteins by way of part (c), what experiments might you use to see whether it is possible that these proteins are specifically actin-bundling proteins?           Question 
3.  You are a UROP student working in a cancer research lab. You were told that, except for blood cells, all normal cells in your body are anchorage-dependent, meaning that they have to grow in or on some sort of extracellular matrix. If cells are deprived of  extracellular matrix, they will not proliferate in the presence of growth factors, and these cells will die by apoptosis.  (a) What can you conclude are two functions of ECM proteins, apart from being the “glue” that holds the cells of your body together?          (b) What is the danger in the ability of some cancerous cells to grow in an anchorage-independent manner?          In your lab, there are two mammary epithelial cell lines available; the two cell lines are called S1 and T4-
4. The two antibodies you have are “inhibitory antibodies” because, when they bind to their substrates, they inhibit the function of their substrates. You are trying to decide whether you need to permeabilize cells before adding these antibodies to the cells. What do you decide and why?             When you treat the different cell types grown in the presence of basement membrane ECM proteins with or without inhibitory antibodies against specific integrins, you obtain the following results:    (h) What do you conclude from these results?             Question 4 .  (a)You are a grad student studying genetic alterations that lead to tumorigenesis. While plating primary cell cultures from a healthy person and a tumor from a cancer patient, you mix up the samples. A colleague suggests that you use the differences in growth properties between the two samples to distinguish them. Describe how the growth properties of cancer cells differ from those of healthy primary cells.            (b) In addition to differences in growth properties, cancer cells also have morphological differences, such as a disorganized cytoskeleton. The Rho family of small GTPases is involved in cytoskeleton regulation, and the pathways that Rho proteins are involved in are implicated in cancer development. Their regulation of the cytoskeleton is thought to be important in cell migration during cell division and invasion of other tissues. In an experiment performed a decade ago, it was found that transfecting NIH 3T3 cells with a construct that expressed a specific mutant form of RhoA could transform these cells. Based on this experiment, would you predict that RhoA is a proto-oncogene or a tumor suppressor gene? Would you predict that the RhoA mutation is a gain-of-function mutation or a loss-of-function mutation? Explain your answers.           (c) In class, we learned about the experiment by the Weinberg lab, in which an oncogenic version of Ras was discovered in cells from a human bladder carcinoma. This was done by transfecting human carcinoma DNA into NIH 3T3 cells (which is a cell line that can grow indefinitely) and looking for the formation of foci (clumps of cells that grow on top of each other). When oncogenic Ras is transfected into Rat Embryonic Fibroblast (REF) cells (a wild-type primary cell culture), it could only partially transform the cells. However, if a hyper-active mutant version of the myc gene is introduced into the REF cells along with the oncogenic version of Ras, the cells are fully transformed. Why did the REF cells require another oncogene to become transformed, while NIH 3T3 cells did not?           (d) Human papillomaviruses (HPVs) are a family of DNA viruses that cause genital warts. HPVs have been predominantly associated with cervical cancer. One of the proteins encoded by the HPV virus is E
5. E5 is a short transmembrane protein that forms a dimer or trimer. E5 can form a stable complex with endogenous host PDGF receptor. Explain how this could lead to cell transformation.           (e) HPV also encodes proteins E6 and E
6. You are working in a cancer research lab studying tumorigenesis in mice.  (a) There are lots of genes that your lab might study! List all of the genes in the following pathways that we have learned about throughout the semester that are oncogenes, and all of the genes that are tumor suppressor genes. i) The Wingless pathway ii) The RTK/Ras pathway                    (b) One of the assays your lab uses is the soft agar colony forming assay. What is the principle behind this assay?           (c) One of the genes studied in your lab is E2F, which is a transcripton factor that controls the G1 to S transition in mammals. i) How is E2F normally regulated in the cell?          ii) How can E2F be inappropriately activated to lead to cancer?          iii) How could you show experimentally that an excess of free E2F can lead to tumorigenesis? (Make sure to include controls in your experiment.)           (d) Another of the genes studied in your lab is Ras. Which of the following changes to wild-type Ras would make it oncogenic? -- if Ras cannot interact with Raf -- if Ras cannot hydrolyze GTP -- if Ras cannot interact with Sos -- if the farnesyl lipid anchor cannot be added to Ras           (e) You have a mouse strain that is predisposed to developing skin cancer. Based on the literature in the cancer field, you come up with a list of 10 potential candidate genes that might be mutated in these mice. You are convinced that the mice of this strain must harbor one of these mutations. How would you determine which candidate gene from the list was actually mutated in this mouse?            (f) When you do the experiment listed above to determine which candidate gene is responsible for the predisposition to developing skin cancer, do you need to take tissue samples from the tumor itself, or can you take tissue from anywhere in the mouse?           (g) You also have a large colony of wild-type mice that you maintain in the lab. Once of these mice develops a disease that looks very similar to chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML). Knowing that a mutation in the c-abl gene often leads to CML in humans, you decide to test your tumorigenic mouse for mutations in c-abl. You design primers upstream and downstream of the c-abl open reading frame and try to perform PCR to amplify the c-abl gene from cancerous cells that you have harvested from your tumorigenic mouse. When you do PCR from a wild-type mouse on c-abl, the PCR reaction works just fine. You cannot get a c-abl PCR product from your tumorigenic mouse, however, no matter how much tweaking of reaction conditions you do. Explain why you can’t get a PCR product for c-abl in the tumorigenic mouse.           (h) Knowing what you know about the c-abl oncogene, how could you use PCR to test for the mutation in your tumorigenic mouse?         Question 
7. You are interested in studying the biology of stem cells.  (a) Explain the difference between embryonic stem cells and adult stem cells. Where would you find each kind of stem cell? How many different cell types can each category of stem cells generate, relative to one another?               (b) A patient has a rare recessive genetic disease due to a loss of function in a specific gene. This disease causes a severe immunodeficiency in the patient. The patient receives a bone marrow transplant, which is successful in alleviating the symptoms of the immunodeficiency disease, and the patient is now in good health. Why did the bone marrow transplant relieve the patient’s symptoms?           (c) Your patient marries a man who is a carrier for the same genetic disease. How do you counsel your patient on the probability of their children inheriting the disease, given that she no longer shows any symptoms of the disease?           (d) One can generate an organismal clone of a sheep by somatic cell nuclear transfer. To do this procedure, you take the nucleus from a cell from “Sheep A” and insert it into the cytoplasm of an enucleated egg taken from “Sheep B.” You then implant the newly-nucleated egg into pseudopregnant “Sheep C.” You do this procedure, and you name your resulting newborn clone “Sheep D.” The cell you took from Sheep A in your experiment was a cell from the immune system that makes antibodies. When Sheep D is born, it is severely immuno-compromised. Sheep D is capable of producing antibodies, but only one kind of antibody against one specific antigen. Normally, an organism can produce an enormously large number of different kinds of antibodies, each one of which can recognize a different antigen. What does this result suggest?                Question 
8. You are working in a lab that is trying to successfully perform stem cell therapy on mice with Parkinson’s Disease by inducing stem cells to become nerve cells in vitro, and then delivering these nerve cells to the diseased mouse’s brain. The mouse you are trying to treat has a form of Parkinson’s Disease that is autosomal recessive and is caused by loss-of-function in the PARK2 gene.  (a) What is a potentially life threatening problem with treating the diseased mouse with stem cells taken from another mouse who is not related at all to the diseased mouse? (b) What are two potential major problems specific to trying to use adult stem cells for your stem cell therapy experiment?        (c) You decide that you want to work with ES cells that are genetically identical to those of the diseased mouse, due to the problems listed in parts (a) and (b). Why can’t you directly isolate such ES cells from the diseased mouse?        (d) You decide to use Somatic Cell Nuclear Transfer in order to derive ES cells that are genetically identical to the diseased mouse. List the steps of the procedure you would need to do to accomplish this.           (e) Before you induce the ES cells you derived in part (d) to become nerve cells, what must you do to the ES cells to make the stem cell treatment actually beneficial to the diseased mouse? (HINT: Re-read the introduction to this question.)

T helper cells are a sub-group of lymphocytes that play an important role in establishing and maximizing the capabilities of the immune system without themselves having any cytotoxic or phagocytic activity. Your lab studies small molecules secreted by T helper cells that activate Natural Killer (NK) cells.   A (2 points). You identify a small glycoprotein Interleukin-79 that is secreted by T helper cells, and seems to activate NK cells. This glycoprotein is particularly highly expressed in a subset of T helper cells which you have purified from primary mouse serum. Why isn’t this primary cell line suitable for long term study?          B (8 points). You now have found the means to generate an immortal T helper cell line by transformation with a tumor cell virus. You want to find the affinity of Interleukin-79 for its unknown receptor on NK cells.  Describe how you would perform a binding experiment to determine this.

You are given two separate cDNAs, each of which encodes a glycoprotein of similar size. One of the cDNAs encodes a protein (protein A)  known to reside in lysosomes, the other encodes a protein (protein B) that is expressed at the cell surface. What tools would you use to distinguish between the localization of the two proteins (you may genetically modify each of the two cDNAs)?       B (4 points). If you were given the nucleotide sequence of the two cDNAs, what type of sequence elements would you be looking for that would indicate that you are dealing with: i)  a secretory protein   ii)  a membrane protein   iii)  a type I versus a type II membrane protein   iv)  a glycoprotein                     C (8 points).

What kind of mutation would you introduce, and what is the expected outcome you are looking for to verify your answers given in part B.  2Name: ______________________________  D (8 points). Having identified each of these cDNAs, you want to determine the intracellular route traveled by each of these glycoproteins, and the speed with which they traverse their biosynthetic pathways to arrive at their final destination.

1. Determine which of the seven identified Drosophila caspase genes are expressed in Drosophila melanogaster S2 cells. SA
2. Identify which of the expressed caspases are downstream of DIAP1 in the apoptosis pathway of S2 cells. SA
3. Explore the order in which expressed initiator and effector caspases are activated and study the function of proteasomal degradation in regulating the initiator caspase DRONC. Background and Significance The apoptotic pathway is critically dependent on the class of cysteine proteases known as caspases, of which seven have been identified in the Drosophila genome (Kumar and Doumanis, 2000; see Table 
004) couple a cleavable peptide substrate to a p-nitroanilide moiety that is colored only when free in solution. Because solution color is directly proportional to the number of free pNA molecules, the optical density of a cell-free lysate treated with caspase substrate provides a proxy measure of caspase activity. Used on cell lysates prepared from double-knockdown RNAi experiments, caspase activity assays can dissect the pathway of caspase activation; for example, if DIAP1 and Caspase A are knocked down and no apoptosis is observed, but Caspase B is active in the cell lysate, one may conclude that Caspase B is upstream of Caspase A. The power of this method is limited by imperfect caspase specificity but should be sufficient to classify caspases as initiators or effectors.  Additionally, an RNAi knockout of a selected proteasome subunit (e.g., Wojcik,

1.  In developmental biology, what is meant by the term “axis”? A set of positional coordinates, that define the relative positions of a specific set of tissues or organs within the embryo. 
2.  Consider these terms in the context of development and evolution. What is a homolog? A DNA sequence in one organism that is similar to that in another organism, and is believed to be evolutionary related. What is a paralog? A DNA sequence related to another in the same species, that is believed to have formed by duplication of an ancestral copy. What is an ortholog? A DNA sequence in one organism corresponding to precisely the same functional sequence in another organism. That is, orthologs are very closely related homologs. What is an analog? Something with a similar function to something else, but that may be unrelated. For example, a bat wing and insect wing. Not usually used in an evolutionary sense, although that is debatable. 
3.  When thinking about experimental design, what is a control? What is a positive control? What is a negative control? Consider the example of in situ hybridization (what is this?) for the gene cyp
1. The Observation During the first cleavage division of the nematode Parascaris aequorum, special cytoplasm, termed the germ plasm, is segregated into one specific daughter cell. Cells that do not inherit the germ plasm undergo a process called chromosome diminution (the chromosomes fragment and much of each chromosome is lost at subsequent divisions). All germ cells are descended from the cell that does inherit the germ plasm and these cells retain their full complement of DNA. The Tasks 
2. The Observation A key question in evolution and development is how the front (fore) limbs and back (hind) limbs become different from one another. That is, how their identity is established. One possible clue comes from expression of the Tbx5 transcription factor, which is normally expressed in the developing forelimbs, but not the developing hindlimb. The Tasks 
3. The observation In classic “transplant” experiments, the future neural plate (nervous system) of a frog embryo was moved from its usual dorsal position to the ventral region of a host embryo. The host and donor embryos were either at the early gastrula or late gastrula stage when the transplant was performed. When the future neural plate of an early gastrula donor is transplanted, it develops as non-neural tissue (epidermis) on the ventral side of the host. However, when the future neural plate of a late gastrula donor is transplanted, it develops as a second neural plate on the ventral side of the host, as diagrammed below.

1) You are interested in establishing the beginning and end of the period in the cerebral cortex of the tasmanian devil (a fierce marsupial found in Tasmania Australia) when cerebral cortex neurons are first born and when neurogenesis is complete. You would also like to establish whether the pattern of cell migration and settling is the same in the tasmanian devil and in mammals such as the ferret, mouse and rhesus monkey.

3. A variety of reagents and approaches are frequently used by developmental biologists to understand the tissue interactions and molecular signaling pathways involved in particular aspects of development. Several of these approaches or reagents are listed below. To determine how well you understand  “how we know what we know” in systems where the forward genetics used in fruit flys and worms is difficult (at best) find one example from your reading and lecture notes where this type of approach was used to demonstrate and important developmental principle. Give the example and the developmental principle illustrated. a) Over-expression of a mRNA in the Xenopus zygote. b) Cross-species injection of an orthologous gene from Drosophila into a developing vertebrate embryo. c) Transgenic mouse carrying the entire regulatory region of Hoxb1 in front of the reporter gene LacZ. d) Knockout mouse for a known patterning gene. e) An incapacitated retrovirus with a strong promotor driving LacZ or green flourescent protein genes. f) Exposure of a specified but undetermined tissue to different “inducing” tissues hypothesized to change the prospective fate of cells. 
1. d.	 How would you determine whether CBFA1 is sufficient to cause bone formation? Describe a plausible experiment and the most important positive and negative controls (one of each) that you would perform. Indicate the purpose of each control. Express CBFA1 protein in non-bone cells. This can be done in mouse embryos by injecting an inducible promoter-driven CBFA1 DNA vector into the zygote and activating expression later. One can do this in a tissue-specific way. I would express CBFA1 in the somites from which most bone is derived and ask whether I later see extra bone made. As a positive control, I would express a protein known to be bioactive via a similar vector. This would indicate that the embryo can respond to proteins expressed ectopically. As a negative control, I would inject the vector alone, or one expressing what should be a non-bioactive protein, such as GFP. e.	 Mutants in BMP2 also fail to form bone. What is BMP2? Briefly describe the pathway by which it acts. BMP2 is a ligand of the TGFbeta superfamily. It binds to serine/threonine kinase receptors. When occupied, these phosphorylate Smads, transcription factors that can translocate to the nucleus when phosphorylated and alter transcription. f.	 How would you determine whether BMP2 and CBFA1 act in the same or different pathways? Describe an experimental approach, 8

1. Dan and Alice Stern have three children – 12 year old Tom, 8 year old Sarah and 6 year old Damien.  At the age of 3, Damien was discovered to have unilateral retinoblastoma and the affected eye was surgically removed.  There is no history of retinoblastoma in either Dan or Alice’s families and Tom and Sarah are also tumor-free. A)  Draw the pedigree for the Stern family. B) Based on the family history, what is the most likely mechanism by which Damien’s retinoblastoma arose?  Your answer should include a brief discussion of how the relevant gene mutation(s) might have arisen. Damien’s parents read on the internet that individual’s with retinoblastoma can have an increased probability of developing other tumors types (e.g. osteosarcoma) relative to the general population. C) Based on the mechanism you proposed above, what would you advice them about Damien’s risk? Briefly explain how you arrived at your answer. Damien grows up, marries and has a son called Simon.  By 16 months of age, Simon has developed tumors in the retinas of both eyes. E)  Add Simon to the Stern family pedigree. F)  Given this situation, what would you now conclude about the most likely mechanism by which retinoblastoma arose in (i) Damien and (ii) Simon.  Briefly explain how you arrived at your answer.

2. You are interested in established a mouse model to study the development, and ultimately, treatment of melanoma.  Someone suggests that you engineer a mouse model that expresses the B-raf V599/600 point mutant. A)  What is the rationale for using the B-raf V599/600 point mutant for your model? B)  What are the issues you will need to worry about in the design of your B-raf V599/600 mouse? Briefly describe how you would engineer the optimal B-raf V599/600 “melanoma” mouse. You successfully generate your mouse and find that it is susceptible to developing pre-neoplastic melanotic lesions, called nevi, but it does not develop malignant melanoma.  You remember that people who inherit a p16 germline mutation are predisposed to develop malignant melanoma.  Thus, you wish to introduce a p16 mutation into your mouse model. You are able to get a p16 heterozygous mutant mouse from a colleague to cross with your B-raf V599/600 “melanoma” mouse. C)  Describe what p16 does and why the p16 gene mutation might be expected to cooperate with the B-raf V599/600 mutant to promote tumor development. D)  Describe the genotype of the animals you would generate to test the affect of p16 mutation in your B-raf V599/600 “melanoma” mouse.  You answer should include the breeding scheme and show the “test” versus “control” animals. You find that the combination of the B-raf and p16 mutations gives you malignant melanomas at very low frequency.  You compare the genotype of these tumors with that of normal tissue. E)  What do you predict about the genotype of (i) the B-raf V599/600 and (ii) p16 in the tumor versus normal tissue?  Briefly explain how you arrived at your answer. F)  Would you expect to find ras mutations these tumors?  Explain how you arrived at your answer.

1. The following information was posted on the WHO web site. http://www.who.int/csr/don/2005_08_03/en/Outbreak associated with Streptococcus suis in pigs in China 3 August 2005 To date, the Ministry of Health in China has reported 206 cases of human disease associated with an outbreak of Streptococcus suis in pigs. Of these human cases, 38 have been fatal. As reported by China, 18 patients are critically ill. Virtually all cases have occurred in Sichuan Province, where infections with Streptococcus suis have been detected in pigs in a concurrent outbreak. The province has one of the largest pig populations in China. Investigation and containment of the outbreak have been given high priority by Chinese authorities. The country’s ministries of health and agriculture are working in close collaboration, and WHO and FAO are being promptly informed of new developments. Investigations conducted by Chinese epidemiologists indicate that the first human cases occurred at the end of June in Ziyang City, Sichuan Province. From 24 June through 21 July, the authorities reported 20 cases of illness, of unknown cause, admitted to three hospitals in that city. WHO was officially informed of the outbreak on 22 July, at which time 20 cases and 9 deaths had been reported. Cases have since been reported in 11 prefectures in Sichuan Province. Most cases reported have occurred in adult male farmers. Information reported to WHO suggests that close contact with diseased or dead pigs is the principal source of human infection. Symptoms reported by local clinicians include high fever, malaise, nausea, and vomiting, followed by meningitis, subcutaneous haemorrhage, toxic shock, and coma in severe cases. The incubation period is short and disease progression is rapid. Local experts are conducting active searches for further cases. To date, Chinese authorities say they have found no evidence of human-to-human transmission. The outbreak in humans has some unusual features and is being closely followed by WHO. Diagnostic testing to further characterize the causative agent is recommended as an essential part of ongoing efforts to understand this outbreak, ensure its rapid containment, and prevent further deaths.

To do this, you start with a culture of 728B cells, mutagenize thesecells, and screen for a new mutant that restores the plating efficiency on Amp-containing media to nearly 100%.  You succeed in finding a strain with thisphenotype, and name this strain 728C.  This time the new mutation responsiblefor suppression maps to the cellular chromosome rather than the plasmid. Suggest one chromosomal gene that might be mutated in the 728C cells andwould cause this suppression.  Explain your answer. What is another phenotype you would expect the 728C cells to have if yourhypothesis is correct? Question

Suggest a hypothesis for the mechanistic basis of the aberrant recombination frequency observed in table 1 for region 
3.  At a loss for an explanation for the poor recombination seen in region 3, you talk to your labmates to see if they have any good ideas.  One smart person suggests that you examine the E. coli genomic sequence immediately surrounding the lac- mutation on the recipient chromosome.  Given that the sequence is readily available, you decide this is an excellent idea.  What sequence motif does your friend suggest you look for?  What distribution of this motif could provide an explanation for your recombination frequency data? You would search for the RuvC consensus sequence because these sites will preventbranch migration from moving through the lac coding region and inhibitrecombination of that region.  There should be RuvC consensus sites immediatelysurrounding the lac coding region. Note:  The answer was not a Chi site consensus sequence because the recombinationfrequency of this region observed in a recD mutant was still low relative to other regions. Question 
4.  You are studying mechanisms by which bacteria acquire andmaintain genes encoding antibiotic resistance.  One strain you are working with(named 728A) is highly resistant to ampicillin; 100% of the cells plated on Amp-containing media form colonies. Knowing that both plasmids and transposons often carry genes imparting drugresistance, you analyze strain 728A and find that it carries a plasmid.  To explorethe mechanisms used by the cells to maintain this plasmid, you mutagenizethe strain, and isolate a variant (called 728B) which loses the ampicillinresistance phenotype at high frequency.  When a liquid culture of 728B is platedon Amp-containing media, typically only 10-15% of the cells give rise to colonies. To investigate why 728B shows reduced inheritance of the ampicillin resistanceplasmid, you purify the plasmid DNA from cultures of 728A and 728B cells andanalyze the DNA on a native agarose gel.  Gel analysis is done both before andafter digesting the DNA with EcoRI, which cleaves the plasmid DNA once. 728A 728 B EcoRI :-+ -+ AmpR plasmid agarose  gel 4A) Based on this analysis, what is a reasonable explanation for the reducedefficiency of plating seen with the 728B cells on Amp-containing media? If plasmids undergo homologous recombination after replicating, they form multimers which must be separated by Site Specific Recombination.  If they are not separated, then only one of the daughter cells will receive the plasmids containing the AmpR genes when the cells divide.  The plasmids isolated from the 728B cells run as monomers, dimers, trimers and tetramers.  When cut with EcorI, which cuts once per plasmid, they all resolve to a band of the same size.  Therefore, this is a mutation in the recombinase or the sites it recognizes. Note that although a replicative transposon would form a cointegrant that would be bigger than the original plasmid, it would not cut back to the same size, as the replicated transposon would add extra length. 4B)  Further analysis of the 728B cells reveals that the mutation causing poorplasmid inheritance is on the plasmid DNA.  Furthermore, the gene encodes atrans-acting factor.  Briefly describe one or two experiments that would supportthese conclusions. Although there are many possible experiments here, you must test plasmid inheritance, NOT look at transcription from a test promoter. For example, transform 728B cells with a wild-type plasmid isolated from 728A with a different marker, such as KanR.  If the mutation is on the plasmid (cis), this new plasmid will be maintained, so the cells will be KanR. If it encodes a trans-acting factor, the cells will also be AmpR. OR: To tell that the mutation is on the plasmid, you could transform the mutant plasmid isolated from 728B into a wild-type strain, and it should then be poorly maintained.  You would then have to come up with another experiment to prove that it's a trans-acting factor. 4C) Given the results in parts a and b, you come up with a hypothesis for thetype of protein that may be encoded by the gene which is mutated in the 728Bcells.  You decide to try to isolate the wild-type protein using a biochemicalapproach.Describe: (
5. You are studying the regulation of the gasguzzler (ggz) gene in a novel bacteria that is able to use Octane as a carbon source.  ggz  is expressed at basal levels in the absence of octane and is induced by addition of octane. You have isolated a mutant, which you call ggmB, which results in constitutive expression of the ggz operon.  Based on genetic evidence, you think that the ggmB encodes a transcriptional repressor. To further study how the GgmB protein represses transcription in the absence of octane, you have purified the GgmB protein.  You use this purified protein to measure binding to the ggz promoter region in vitro using gel mobility shift asssays.  You use radiolabeled dsDNA that contains ~200 basepairs upstream of the ggz gene as a substrate for DNA binding.  The results of your assay are shown below: Gel Shift Assay GgmB Protein - +  + Octane - - + ggz promoter DNA 5A.  Based on these results, how do you think octane regulates GgmB activity? Octane causes GgmB to dissociate from the promoter DNA.  Since addition of octane activates gene expression, dissociation of GgmB must relieve repression. You want to determine how GgmB represses transcription of gasguzzler.  To this end you perform assays to look at RNAP binding, promoter unwinding, and transcription product length in an in vitro assay that shows octane-dependent expression of the ggz promoter.  Your results are shown below. DNA Unwinding Assay Transcription Assay RNAP + s GgmBOctane Gel Shift Assay --+  + +  + +-++-- - + +  + -+ ggz promoter DNA+  + ++-- - + +  + -+ RNAP + s GgmBOctane Txn start site +  + +-- - + + - + + + RNAP + s GgmBOctane * 2,000 bp 1,000 bp 100 bp 10 bp 5B .  Based on this data, describe a model for the mechanism that GgmB uses to regulate ggz promoter function.  Include in your description the stages in the transcription process that are affected and how octane-dependence is conferred. -The gel shift assay shows that when RNA pol. holoenzyme is incubated withpromoter DNA in the presence of GgmB and the absence of octane, a larger, moreintense band is observed than with RNA pol. holenzyme alone or RNA pol.holoenzyme + GgmB + octane.  The larger band indicates that both GgmB and RNApol. holoenzyme are bound to the promoter.  The more intense band indicates that more of the promoter DNA molecules are occupied by RNA pol. holoenzyme +GgmB.  This shows that GgmB stimulates closed complex formation.-The DNA unwinding assay shows that in the absence of octane, GgmB alsostimulates open complex formation by RNA pol. holoenzyme so that you observeunwinding on more DNA molecules.  This is evidenced by the more intense bandaround the transcription start site and the decreased full length band at the top ofthe gel.  (This gel is a lower resolution gel than the gels that were in the paper youread, this is why you don’t see distinct bands at the site of promoter unwinding. This is also why you see the full length primer extension product at the top of thegel.)-The transcription assay shows that in the absence of octane, GgmB reduces theamount of full length transcript formed, although the amount of abortive transcriptis increased.  This indicates that the RNA pol. holenzyme is defective in promoterclearance.  This result would be observed if GgmB stabilized the unstable ternarycomplex.-Together, all of these results fit the following model.  GgmB (in the absence ofoctane) strongly interacts with RNA pol. holoenzyme.  This interaction stimulates closed and open complex formation by RNA pol. holoenzyme.  This interaction also stabilizes the unstable ternary complex.  Therefore, in the absence of octane the RNA pol holoenzyme is bound to the promoter and unable to transcribe the ggzgene in the absence of octane, but is primed for ggz transcription when octane isadded to the cells.  This mechanism is similar to the mechanism observed by N-HSrepression of rRNA transcription in E. coli. Question 6 You are a graduate student in a lab working on prokaryotic transcription. You decide that you are interested in creating a very strong promoter that gives very high transcription rates.  As you think about how to do this, you start thinking about the conundrum that RNA polymerase holoenzyme must deal with.  It must bind DNA in a site-specific manner at the promoter but then must move away from the promoter and transcribe DNA into RNA in a non-site-specific manner. 6A. How does the RNA polymerase holoenzyme accomplish these tasks? The holoenzyme contains the sigma factor that help the RNAP bind the promotersite-specifically.  Once that occurs, the holoenzyme goes through conformationalchanges that cause it to bind sigma less tightly (or not at all) so that the RNAP canrelease the promoter and continue elongation. You know that strong prokaryotic promoters often have –10 and –35 sites that have sequences that are close to the consensus sequence and that they also often have an UP element. You decide to take a strong prokaryotic promoter, whose sigma factor is called
1.  You are interested in understanding the residues of a specific group I intron that function specifically in catalysis of the splicing reaction.  To probe this question, you mutagenize the intron and, using an in vivo screen, isolate mutant variants that are splicing-defective. Because group I introns contain many regions of secondary structure that are important for folding of the RNA but probably are not directly involved in catalysis, you decide to initially examine your mutant RNAs for those defective in folding.  These mutants will be set aside, as they are unlikely to have specific defects in the catalytic steps. 1a  (6 points).  You find that it is relatively easy to isolate the unprocessed RNA from your mutant cell lines.  With this in mind, suggest a type of analysis you could use to probe for mutants that have defects in RNA folding.  Explain what controls you will use, and how you will decide if the mutant is a folding defect. 1b  (7 points).  After setting aside the folding mutants, you wish to further screen your mutants for those that are good candidates for having specific catalytic defects.  You decide it will be easier to look for mutants that have defects in the second splicing step. Your idea is to look for mutant RNAs that accumulate the intermediates expected of an RNA that can catalyze the first step successfully, but show a complete defect in the second step. Given the schematic of the full length pre-RNA shown below, draw the structure of the RNAs you would expect to see after an in vitro splicing reaction for a mutant RNA that is defective in the second step. 1Also, in addition to your purified pre-mRNA, what components would you add to the in vitro splicing reaction? 1c  (7 points).  Using the strategy outlined above, you successfully identify several mutant RNAs that are specifically defective in carrying out the second splicing reaction. You are most interested in mutants that identify residues that are truly part of the active site that catalyzes this reaction.  Therefore, you next want to determine if the mutant RNAs are or are not defective in the tertiary structure rearrangement that is necessary prior to the second splicing step, as mutants defective in this rearrangement reaction are less interesting to you. Suggest a genetic or biochemical method that will allow you to screen out mutants that are defective in the rearrangement .  A general description of the method, without experimental details is sufficient. Using this method, what result would you expect to see for the mutants that are truly defective in catalysis? What result would you expect for the rearrangement-defective mutants? 2 Question 
2. You are studying the pathogenic fungus C. albicans, and when you sequence one of its mitochondrial genes you find that it has a novel intron.  Analysis of its sequence suggests that it may be related to the group II self-splicing introns.  Your first step in studying the intron’s structure is to mutagenize it. 2A.

You use an RNA fragment corresponding to the intron sequence shown above, labelled at its 5’end, as a substrate.  You visualize the digested products by autoradiography.  The smallest piece you can distinguish on the gel is 5 bases in length, based on control size standards. 4Wild type S1	 Snake Venom Mut. A S1  Snake Venom Mut.

You separate these proteins on a SDS polyacrylamide gel and then do a western blot with an primary antibody to BLG

5) and U2AF interact with the mutant pre-mRNA at least as well as they do with the pre-mRNA from the wild-type gene.  The assembled splicesomes, however, never generate active complexes or catalyze even the first step of splicing. Based on these results, in which of the splicing signals on the pre-mRNA (5’ splice site, branch site, polypyrimidine track, or 3’ splice site) would you expect the mutation 10preventing splicing to lie?  Justify your answer by suggesting a molecular explanation for the splicing defect. 4C. Your lab has identified a drug that treats the SNOZ disease.  You find that splicing of pre-mRNA is partially restored in cells from these treated individuals.  What type of splicing factor might, if highly expressed, generate this recovered phenotype?

6.  After graduating, you decide to work in a lab at a large Agrotechfirm for a summer.  You are surprised to learn that production of the amino acidLysine is a major effort at the company.  Indeed, your advisor assures you thateven a 1% increase in the amount of Lysine produced by a production bacteriumis worth ~$10,000,000 a year for the company. Your advisor has identified a new bacterium, K. expressus, that holds promise as a high Lysine expressor.  You are given the task of determining theregulation of lysine biosynthesis operon in these bacteria. You first set out to determine how addition of amino acids to the growthmedia effects expression of the operon.  You perform both a northern blot of theLys operon mRNA and a western blot using an antibodies to two differentproteins (LysA and LysC) expressed from the mRNA.  You obtain the followingresults: Amino Acids  +  _ +  _+  _ Lys OperonNorthern Blot LysA Western Blot  LysC Western Blot 6A Based on these observations what can you conclude about how theexpression of the K. expressus lysine biosynthetic genes are regulated? 16You next determine the sequence of the entire expressed mRNA and findthat there is a short open reading frame upstream of the three Lys biosynthetic genes.

What data allows you to exclude this hypothesis?  Why? The presence of three Lys codons in the leader peptide still seems suspicious.Although there are no potential hairpins adjacent to the short open readingframes, you notice that the RBS of LysA is unusually close to the stop codon ofthe leader peptide. 17 To address whether the leader peptide functions in the regulation of theLys genes, you construct a hybrid operon in which the LacZ open reading frame(ORF) is precisely substituted for the LysA ORF (see image below).  You then make three mutations in the leader peptide coding region.

What type of mRNA mutation do you propose to construct to address thecoupling between the leader peptide and LacZ/LysA expression?  What results would you expect if your model is correct?  (hint: you can make insertions,deletions, or substitution mutants) As a further test of your hypothesis you mutate the stop codon of theleader peptide from UGA to UAA.  You find that this increases the level of β-Gal expression in the presence of amino acids by two-fold (from 20-25 to 50-60 units). 6E. How does your hypothesis explain this observation?  What effect on LacZ expression would you expect if you over-expressed RF-1 in cells with theunmutated LacZ-fusion construct?  RF-2?

1.  You are interested in understanding the residues of a specific group I intron that function specifically in catalysis of the splicing reaction.

With this in mind, suggest a type of analysis you could use to probe for mutants that have defects in RNA folding.  Explain what controls you will use, and how you will decide if the mutant is a folding defect. You can identify mutants in RNA folding by isolating the unprocessed RNA from wt and each of your mutants (1 pt), end-labeling it, digesting each with either S1 nuclease or snake venom RNAse individually (1 pt), and running the products out on a denaturing gel (1 pt).  S1 nuclease will digest ssRNA and SV will digest dsRNA (1 pt).  You will compare the banding pattern in each of the mutants to the wild type pattern.  Any ‘footprints’ that differ from the wt will indicate a mutant in RNA folding (2 pts). 1b  After setting aside the folding mutants, you wish to further screen your mutants for those that are good candidates for having specific catalytic defects.  You decide it will be easier to look for mutants that have defects in the second splicing step.  Your idea is to look for mutant RNAs that accumulate the intermediates expected of an RNA that can catalyze the first step successfully, but show a complete defect in the second step.

You are most interested in mutants that identify residues that are truly part of the active site that catalyzes this reaction.

A general description of the method, without experimental details is sufficient. Using this method, what result would you expect to see for the mutants that are truly defective in catalysis? What result would expect for the rearrangement-defective mutants? You would like to eliminate mutants that are defective in tertiary structure formation.  Normally, regions P1 and P7 come together in step 1 and regions P1 and P9 come together in step 2 of group I intron splicing (2pts). These interactions can be tested by using a crosslinking reagent (3 pts). Since you would like to identify mutants in the active site of the RNA, you will study mutants that crosslink similarly to the wild type RNA, but fail to catalyze the second step (2pts). Question 
4)  Reverse transcription of the original mRNA will create a weird little hairpin that can serve as a primer for synthesizing the second cDNA strand.  Use DNA Polymerase I to make a double stranded cDNA. 
5) and U2AF interact with the mutant pre-mRNA at least as well as they do with the pre-mRNA from the wild-type gene.  The assembled splicesomes, however, never generate active complexes or catalyze even the first step of splicing. Based on these results, in which of the splicing signals on the pre-mRNA (5’ splice site, branch site, polypyrimidine track, or 3’ splice site) would you expect the mutation preventing splicing to lie?  Justify your answer by suggesting a molecular explanation for the splicing defect. The Snoz mRNA is not processed properly in the mutant even though the snRNPsand U2AF can bind.  There are two possible answers. The 5’ splice site could bemutated causing U1 to bind more tightly so that U6 is not able to compete effectivelyfor the 5’ splice site.  If U6 cannot bind then U2 cannot interact with U6 and the first step of the splicing reaction cannot occur.  The second possiblity is that the criticalA residue in the branch site is mutated.  This mutation does not preclude U2binding but prevents the 2’-OH from attacking the 5’ splice site.  There was a hint in the problem to help you avoid this model (a low level of mature mRNA isproduced) but it was confusing since later it says that spliceosomes never generateactive complexes.  Credit was given for this answer even though it was not what wewere looking for.  To get full credit, you needed to have an answers as well as aclear explanation.) 4C.

You have now found that some mutant cells are able to recover and are asked to suggest a type of splicing factor that could rescue the splicing defect foundin Snoz mutants.  Using the first model from above, the dead box proteins that act ashelicases and unwind RNA duplexes could suppress the tight binding of U

The northern blot shows that lys operon transcription is not regulated by thepresence of amino acids.  The western blots of Lys A and LysC show that LysA andLysC are regulated post-transcriptionally, with protein expression low in thepresence of amino acids and high in the absence of amino acids.

If this operon was regulated by transcriptional attenuation, then you would expectthe size and amount of the RNA to change in the presence of amino acids. You didnot observe this in the northern blots for part A. Partial credit was given if you listed all the parts of a transcriptional attenuator(stem loop followed by a run of U’s in the mRNA) that would be absent based on thecoding sequence you were given.

This positioning allows theribosome translating the end of the leader peptide to block binding of thedownstream rbs by another ribosome.  In the wild type construct, this situation willoccur in the presence of amino acids.  In the absence of amino acids, the ribosome will stall at the 3 Lys codons.  In this case, the ribosome does not block the downstream rbs, so a new ribosome can bind and translate LysA/LacZ.  The phenotypes of the mutants can be interpreted in the context of this model. Mutant 1(AUG-UUG):  Leader peptide is not translated, so no ribosome is presentat the end of the leader peptide to block translation of downstream gene.  Therefore, you observe high levels of LacZ expression in the presence and absence of aminoacids. Mutant 2 (KKK-EVN):  Removing the three Lys codons (KKK) at the beginning ofthe leader peptide removes the site of ribosome pausing.  Therefore, ribosome translates leader peptide in the presence and absence of amino acids and this blocksdownstream translation. Mutant 3 (KKK-EVN, FSR-KKK):  Moving the Lys codons to the end of the leader peptide restores pausing of the ribosome, but now it is at the end of the gene, whereit is optimally positioned to block translation of the downstream gene. 15Other models, if they were plausible and could explain all the mutant phenotypeswere accepted. Although your advisor likes your model, she feels that additional mRNAmutations outside of the leader peptide coding sequence will be necessary to testyour hypothesis. 6D What type of mRNA mutation do you propose to construct to addressthe coupling between the leader peptide and LacZ/LysA expression?  What results would you expect if your model is correct?  (hint: you can makeinsertions, deletions, or substitution mutants) Based on the model in 1C, the best test of your model would be to insert sequencesbetween the end of the leader peptide and the rbs of the downstream gene.  If yourmodel is correct, then increasing the spacing should result in constitutive expressionof LacZ. Other experiments were accepted if they were explained, related to your model, andprovided information that was significantly different from the information providedby the mutants in part 1C. As a further test of your hypothesis you mutate the stop codon of theleader peptide from UGA to UAA.  You find that this increases the level of β-Gal expression in the presence of amino acids by two-fold (from 20-25 to 50-60 units). 6E  How does your hypothesis explain this observation?  What effect on LacZ expression would you expect if you over-expressed RF-1 in cells with theunmutated LacZ-fusion construct?  RF-2?

The answers to the questions should be in the form of a 2 PAGE ESSAY,The essay should synopsize the important points of the paper that pertain to thequestion (no more than two paragraphs) and propose an answer to the questions posed.The quality of the answer will depend on the quality of the supporting arguments as well as the quality of the presentation. Criteria for evaluation: 
1) have a population of unreplicated cells that can beused as an unreplicated control DNA sample and 
2) obtain cells that are goingthrough DNA replication synchronously.  Partial credit was given for either of thesetwo answers and full credit was given if both answers were included. Because of the thermophilic nature of the S. mokin your students identify aurea (a mild protein denaturant) sensitive initiation mutant.  With the mutant in hand, you buy the DNA microarrays and perform an assay to map origins at twodifferent growth temperatures.  The replicating DNA is labeled green and theunreplicated control DNA is labeled red.  Your student obtains the followingresults (the arrows indicate the position of the replicator sequences that yourstudent has already mapped). 2
3) that show defects in maintaining their telomerelength.  You clone the wild-type version of each mutant gene and find that TEL1 and TEL3 encode proteins.  In contrast, TEL2 does not include any protein-codingregions greater than 6 amino acids. 3B (4 points).  You suspect that TEL2 encodes the telomerase RNA.  Based on your knowledge of telomerase function, what RNA sequence would you predictwould be encoded by this gene?  Please indicate the polarity of the sequence. The RNA sequence of the telomerase contains

Which sequence causes her to come tothis conclusion and why? Sequence 3 is not a palindrome-the methylation sites need to be thesame on both strands so that the sequence can be recognized and methylationstate assessed on both strands by MutH.Partial credit was given if you wrote that sequence 1 wouldn’t workbecause it would occur too infrequently in the genome. 9

2) that are strongly-expressed after the virus infects cells (remember, plants are eukaryotes!). Suspecting these proteins are responsible for cell killing, you purify both proteins, obtain partial protein sequence, and mapped the coding sequences to two ORFs in the viral genome.  Upon further investigation, you find that the DW1 ORF overlaps (but is in a different reading frame) with the DW2 ORF (see diagram below). 4A (6 Points).  You decide that either there must be a RNA Pol II promoter in the DW1 ORF to drive transcription of the DW2 mRNA or the two proteins are being expressed from the same mRNA.  Propose an experiment that could distinguish between these two possibilities.  You have access to any radiolabeled DNA that you need. There are several possible answers to this question – here is an example:  To determine whether DW1 and DW2 are expressed from the same mRNA, do a Northern blot with labeled complementary DNA to both DW1 and DW
3) that is required for DW2 synthesis. Interestingly, DW3 has a clear RNA binding motif and you find that it binds to a 18 base hairpin sequence located at position 3710 in the viral genome. 4D (5 points).  You wonder whether DW3 might directly recruit the eukaryotic small ribosomal subunit to the mRNA.  Propose an experiment to test this possibility. To test for DW3 binding to the small ribosomal subunit, you can do a ribosome binding assay.  In this assay, you would radiolabel DW3 and incubate the purified protein with purified ribosome (small subunit only).  Put this mixture over a gel filtration column (ribosome too big for gel shift assay), and determine whether the radiolabeled protein elutes near where the ribosome elutes from the column.  If so, it would suggest that DW3 is binding to the ribosome.  You must run each protein separately to determine where they elute from the column by themselves.  Look for ribosome by doing a Northern Blot looking for the 16S rRNA. You find no evidence that DW3 binds to pure 40S ribosomal subunits.  In contrast, you find that if you perform the same experiment using ribosomes in a crude translation extract, you observe a clear association between DW3 and the 40S subunit. 4E (4 points).  Given your knowledge of the events of eukaryotic translation initiation, why does it make sense that the purified 40S subunit is unable to associate with DW

Any two of these, clearly identified, will get you full credit    Question 2  (a) The Orbelli effect is potentiation of neuromuscular transmission aftersympathetic stimulation of the animal.   Part of the sympathetic fight-or-flight response, it helped your forbears pursue and eat cute little deer and escape from  fierce saber-tooth tigers.  (b)  Set up spinal (headless) frog, with accessible sartorius or cutaneus pectorisneuromuscular junction.  Put (extracellular) stimulating electrode on motornerve, record intracellularly from muscle fiber. Curarize animal to partially block neuromuscular transmission so you don’t get action potentials (low calciumworks less well but is an acceptable substitute). Stimulate motor nerve, increase stimulus until the motor neuron axon to your muscle fiber fires; record excitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSP) in millivolts.   Stimulate animal’s sympathetic nervous system by electrically stimulating spineor directly stimulating preganglionic nerves. Then fire motorneuron axon againand record change (increase in EPSP).   (c)  The presynaptic mechanism proceeds from norepinephrine released fromlocal sympathetic nerve terminals, and results in an increase in quantal content(therefore decrease in failures).  Pure presynaptic facilitation can be obtained by treating preparation with norepinephrine or by running the experiment in (b) inthe presence of an alpha-adrenergic receptor antagonist such as clonidine.  The postsynaptic mechanism proceeds from circulating epinephrine (adrenaline) from the adrenal gland), and results in an increase in quantal size (mostconveniently measured with spontaneous minis).  A pure postsynaptic responsecan be obtained with s specific beta agonist such as isoproterenol or by running(b) above in the presence of a beta-adrenergic receptor blocker such as beta-propanolol.  (d)  The postsynaptic mechanism goes through beta-adrenergic receptors and has its effect in the closure of (non-ion-specific) conductance channels on the whole muscle fiber, resulting in an increase in the cell’s leakage resistance to any applied current.  This results in an increase in quantal size in response to a givensynaptic current; V=IR, and can be measured by putting a second micropipetteinto the muscle fiber, injecting varying measured amounts of current through it, and plotting the consequent voltage excursions as a function of current.  One observes the increased resistance as an increase in the slope R = dV/dI.   Question

To conduct sodium and calcium ions it  needs to bind glutamate, released from the presynaptic terminal. – But for efficient  conduction it also requires depolarization of the postsynaptic membrane, to avoid (by charge repulsion) magnesium blockade.  f) The NMDA receptor’s function was described on the membrane of pyramidal cells in  hippocampal region CA1, on the postsynaptic side of synapses made by Schaeffer  collaterals onto these cells.  g) Its conduction requirements (see e above) make it a logical and gate – a Hebbian molecule.  Experiments with APV show that it mediates only a small fraction of normal synaptic transmission but is necessary for all synaptic plasticity –LTP in this  lecture.  h) NMDA receptor function is required for normal hippocampal-dependent learning as  assayed in the Morris Water Maze hidden-platform task.  This is shown by the disruption of such learning in rats injected (intraventricularly) with APV or in mice with genetically engineered knockouts of the gene encoding an essential subunit of the NMDA receptor.

Photosynthesis: CO2 + H2O + light   CH2O + O2 Respiration: O2 + CH2O   CO2 + H2O + energy/ATP b. You measure the CO2 concentration in the air over Alaska for one year and then plot your measured concentration minus the average annual concentration as a function of time.  Explain the seasonal variation in CO2 concentration illustrated in the figure below.  Would you expect to see the same pattern if you measured CO2 in the atmosphere over Chile?  Why or why not? The increase in CO2 from January-April is due to atmospheric mixing and respiration.  As trees start to photosynthesize and the summer season begins, CO2 drawdown occurs, reaching a maximum in July-August.  The inflection point in September-October is due to reduced photosynthesis and increased respiration.  Increasing CO2 in November-December is again due to atmospheric mixing and respiration.  In Chile, you would expect the seasonal cycle to be inverted with significantly dampened oscillations.  This is a product of opposite seasons and less landmass in the Southern Hemisphere. c. The CO2 concentration in the atmosphere has increased drastically as a result of human activities over the past 100 years.  In addition, the global O2 concentration in the atmosphere has decreased, as shown in the graph below.

Water milfoil (Myriophyllum) is an invasive Eurasian genus of aquatic plants found in North American lakes and ponds.  Spirogyra is a form of filamentous green algae that are native to North American freshwater ecosystems. Trout Snail Milfoil Mosquito Larvae Daphnia Spirogyra a. In order to help save the native Spirogyra population, you have a few measures available to you.  You can either adjust the trout population (by adding more trout or by encouraging more fishing) or you can adjust the mosquito larvae population (by adding more larvae or by applying a biocide that only kills mosquito larvae).  Which measure would be most effective at increasing the population of Spirogyra? Why?  Clearly state all assumptions. Increasing the population of mosquito larvae is the most direct method of increasing the population of Spirogyra.  Increasing mosquito larvae will decrease the population of Daphnia, which feed exclusively on Spirogyra.  There are a number of secondary effects that could be argued depending on the assumed time scale and response of populations. b. A golf course is built upstream of the pond.  The fertilizers from the runoff cause a 50% increase in the primary productivity of both milfoil and Spirogyra.  By how much would you expect the productivity of snails and Daphnia to increase?  Assume the ecological efficiency at each trophic level is 10%.  Show calculations and explain your reasoning. The productivity of snails and Daphnia will both increase by 50%.  Assuming a trophic level transferefficiency of 10%, we can project how the increase in productivity will cascade through the food web. P = total primary productivity before golf course and

How is the hydrologic cycle expected to change over the next century?  Be sure to note sources in your answer. Global warming is expected to accelerate the hydrologic cycle, effectively increasing global evapotranspiration and precipitation.  Some snowfall will become rainfall.  The melting of the snowpack and spring flood will occur earlier.  Semiarid regions are expected to experience more droughts. Sea level rise will result in saltwater intrusion of coastal aquifers. b.

2. (6 points) On Prof. DeLong’s recent trip to the Galapagos Islands he took some time to study the predation habits of carnivorous land iguanas.  He noticed that the iguanas on Isabela Island eat a wide variety of food, while on Hood Island they eat just one or two kinds of prey. a. Explain why these differences in diet selection exist using the concepts presented in your lecture notes and textbook.  Describe the conditions under which you would expect to find an iguana eating many or few kinds of prey. According to optimal foraging theory, the profitability of prey is the energy value per handling time (Th). When Th is much greater than search time, Ts, each prey must have a high energy value to make the investment of handling time worthwhile, so iguanas should be specialists.  When Ts is much greater than Th, then even though the prey energy value may be low, consuming prey is profitable.  Under these conditions a predator should be a generalist. Differences in diet selection could also result from interspecific competition.  If on Isabella Island iguanas are able to realize their entire fundamental niche, they will be able to eat a wide variety of food.  If competition for food is high on Hood Island, iguanas will have a much smaller realized niche and only be able to successfully acquire a small range of prey species. b. On Hood Island, he observed that the iguanas are very efficient at eating centipedes.  However, the centipedes do not go extinct because they can maintain a small population in tiny holes that the iguanas can’t enter.  Which of the following graphs represents this situation? Explain your selection and sketch the outcome on the figure. The graph on the right represents the case of prey refuges, where a portion of the prey population is able to escape predation, even at high predator densities.  The intersection of the predator isocline at the peak of the prey isocline suggests a relatively efficient predator.  As a result, both populations tend to oscillate in a stable manner. c. On closer investigation, Prof. DeLong discovered that when the centipede population density is low, iguanas on this island eat almost exclusively beetles, while at moderate to high centipede population densities, the iguanas eat almost exclusively centipedes.  Draw the predation response to centipede density. Be sure to label your axes.  Identify and explain this type of functional response. This is a Type III functional response.  The attack rate is very low at low prey densities, and then increases as prey increases.  At high prey densities, handling time limits predation.  In this case, the predator exhibits prey switching.

Identify and explain the type of competition described in this paper. Exploitative competition occurs when one competitor has the superior capability to gather resources, as opposed to directly interfering with the other organism. The paper explains that exploitative competition has two main components, the consumer’s per capita consumption rate (α) and its conversion efficiency (ε). Usually these two components are combined into one equation that is density dependent, but in this paper they examine how each component differs between the two snail species. b. Write the Lotka-Volterra competition equation for Cerithidea californica in general terms. c. What is the invasion criteria described in the Byers paper?  Define each variable.

Write an opinion (~400 words) about how the concepts that you have learned in class relate and contribute to the existence of Humpty Dumpty communities and Ghosts.  Use specific examples from your readings and lecture notes to support your arguments.  If you use any outside sources, please cite them. A few examples of concepts in class that could be related to the Judson article are described below: ! dNC.californicadt=rC.californicaNC.californicaKC.californica"NC.californica"#NB.attramentariaKC.californica$ % & & ’ ( ) ) Humpty Dumpty Communities Keystone Species, Predator-Prey Models – Keystone species have a large influence on the structure and stability of an ecosystem.  If these species are eliminated, the ecosystem is fundamentally changed and “broken” without any possibility for repair.  Usually the keystone species is a predator.  Once removed, the organisms that it suppresses through predation explode in population and outcompete other species.  An example of this is in California kelp forests, where sea otters are crucial to keeping sea urchins in check. When the sea otter population is reduced (by hunting, habitat degradation, etc.), urchins multiply and consume the kelp forest.  This removes habitat for organisms that live in the kelp forest and thus the ecosystem turns into an urchin barren.  If one were to reintroduce kelp, urchins would consume it immediately.  If you try to reintroduce sea otters, they have no habitat (they also live in the kelp). Fundamental vs. Realized Niches – When one species is removed from an ecosystem, other species on the same trophic level (that they compete with) may expand their realized niches.  These species now have the potential to evolve with the ecosystem and completely occupy/expand their fundamental niche, making it hard for the old species to move back in.  This could potentially occur if one species of Darwin’s finch were removed from the Galapagos or a particular species was overfished. Ghosts Invasive Species – When a new species is introduced to a system, it may push another species to extinction; however, the introduced species may go extinct shortly afterward.  In the Byers paper there is a parasite that leaves the invasive species of snails, B. attramentaria, essentially castrated and unable to reproduce.  If this parasite were to wipe out B. attramentaria after it outcompetes the native population, the ecosystem is fundamentally changed with neither snail present.  Examples of exotic species introduced to systems in lecture tended to show that the invasive species became established and altered the system without becoming ghosts, which supports the Judson’s assertion that ghosts are relatively rare. Nutrient Loading – Adding unnatural amounts of phosphate, nitrogen, or other nutrient (such as iron) can create abnormally large populations of organisms (e.g. phytoplankton, zooplankton, etc.).  However, nutrient loading may be cyclic or short-lived, such that the large populations created by the loading disappear, even though their presence may have significantly altered the food web through competition with other organisms and utilization of nutrients. MIT OpenCourseWare http://ocw.mit.edu

5. (15 points) Your TAs have decided to take you to the Harvard Forest instead of Plum Island for the class field trip.  The diagram below indicates the general nitrogen cycle in this particular ecosystem. A B a. Label what form of nitrogen or what process is occurring at: A Dead Organic N B NH4 + (Ammonium) C C Denitrification b. On your field trip, the TAs take you to a part of the forest where a clear-cutting experiment is being conducted.  One of the TAs notes that the soil is losing nitrogen to surface and groundwater runoff.  Explain why. Internal cycling of nitrogen is an important component of the terrestrial nitrogen budget.  Plants are vital to this internal cycling, as they both assimilate dead organic nitrogen that has been mineralized to ammonium and nitrate that has been produced from nitrite by nitrifying bacteria. If plants are not present to uptake and store nitrate and ammonium, they are leached from the soil. c. In what major ways does the nitrogen cycle differ from the phosphorous cycle?  Specifically, compare and contrast the flow of nitrogen and phosphorous through Earth’s biosphere. Nitrogen is plentiful and cycles readily throughout the biosphere.  Humans can create ammonium from nitrogen gas using the Haber-Bosch process, and thus have an incredibly large influence on the nitrogen cycle.  Phosphorous, in contrast, is scarce and travels on a “one-way street” from soils and rocks to the ocean.  Humans also have a large impact on the phosphorous cycle. Phosphorous is mined to use in fertilizers, and while some phosphorous taken up by plants, much of it runs off to oceans where it is stored in relatively inaccessible marine sediments. MIT OpenCourseWare http://ocw.mit.edu

By the availability of N?  Explain your answer. b) A resort-house development is proposed to be built around Lake Balance leading to the use of large numbers of septic systems around the lake. (Septic systems leach nitrogenous compounds into the groundwater, and the groundwater ultimately carries them to the lake). Would Lake Balance start to look more like Trout Lake or Big Lake over time? c) The development goes ahead, and the concentrations of NO3 in Lake Balance skyrocket.  At the same time, the housing developments around the lake began to leach sewage into the lake, increasing its P supply.  What might happen to the oxygen concentrations in the deep waters of Lake Balance over time and why?  What is this process called? Bonus: To mitigate the effects of the added nitrate from sewage coming from the new homes surrounding Lake Balance, the local wastewater treatment authority proposes an innovative solution.  Rather than trying to install a sewer system across the entire, remote area, they propose using denitrifying bacteria to convert the nitrate in groundwater to nitrogen gas.  They set up an anaerobic ground system and test it.  Initially they find that there are fast rates of denitrification, but these rates soon slow down.  There is still a lot of nitrate to be reduced and the environment is still anaerobic.  What would you recommend adding to the system to help spur further denitrification?

2.  With respect to the carbon cycle, please answer each of the following questions in a sentence or two: a) Which ‘compartment’, terrestrial or marine, has the slowest biological carbon turnover? Why do these compartments differ in terms of organic carbon turnovers? The terrestrial compartment has the slowest biological carbon turnover because the primary producers on land (trees, etc.) have longer lifespans than primary producers in the ocean (phytoplankton). Thus, once fixed, carbon stays in the biomass for longer. Note: although the biological pump may sequester a small amount of carbon by sinking of phytoplankton, this amount is so small that it doesn’t change the mean residence time of carbon substantially. b) Which has the longest mean residence time for CO2, the deep-sea, or ocean surface waters? Why ? The deep-sea. Downwelling at the poles brings cold water (in which dissolved gases are more soluble) deep into the ocean basins. Here, the water cannot undergo air-sea exchange since it is sealed off from contact with the atmosphere. This is the so-called “physical pump” of carbon dioxide. c) Fossil fuel burning and deforestation release about 
3.  In class and in your readings, you learned about the long-term ecological experimentation done at the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest in New Hampshire. -a) Explain the biogeochemical mechanisms by which clear-cutting leads to increased NO3leaching from forest soils. Clear cutting contributes to the buildup of ammonium in soils that are warm and moist.  This stimulates nitrification by microbes, creating a much larger nitrate pool in the soil.  The nitrate is negatively charged (compared to ammonium which is positively charged) and thus is not held by the negatively charged soil particles. Increased runoff of water from the system leaches this increased nitrate out. b) Explain biogeochemically why there is more Ca2+ ion leaching from clear-cut forests. The process of nitrification also acidifies, which creates more hyrdrogen ions that replace Ca2+ cations and leach it from the system with increased runoff. c) Over the last fifty years, even in intact forests ,Ca2+has been depleted from the soils.  Explain what was the ultimate cause of this depletion, and how it caused it. Acid rain from sulfur dioxide emissions in industry. The hydrogen ions replace calcium cations at ion exchange sites in the soil, creating calcium leaching. d) What is wollastonite (exact chemical formula), what were they doing with it at Hubbard Brook and why?

1. (25 points) a) Explain Liebig’s Law of the Minimum.  Describe and provide an example of how limiting factors can make complex systems easier to understand. Liebig’s Law of the Minimum states that the growth of a plant is dependent on the element that is in least supply relative to the needs of the plant. Often one nutrient is limiting, which simplifies complex systems because only the cycling of one nutrient needs to be described thoroughly.  For example, in high-nutrient low-chlorophyll areas of the ocean, productivity is determined primarily by the flux of iron into the system. b) Onondaga Lake is located in Syracuse, NY and has experienced extensive cultural eutrophication.

2.  Short Answer: Please answer each of the following in no more than one sentence.  A phrase or a few words are acceptable. a) Why are we concerned about the future of the phosphorus cycle? The mining of phosphorous by humans has rapidly increased the flux of P from land to ocean sediment, where it is essentially inaccessible to ecosystems. b) What do stromatolites tell us about the origins of life on Earth? Stromatolites give information about the origins of photosynthesis based on carbon isotope data. c) What data from Lake Vostok ice cores inform our understanding of climate change?

1.  What is the global purpose of the described experiments?  The abstract must always state the purpose of a given set of experiments including the global problem into which the research fits.  Often in the biological sciences we are working on a small facet of a much more global disease or disorder.  The global impact of the work should be mentioned as well as the hypothesis directly addressed by the subsequent experiments.    For example, if I was working on identifying specific interaction partners of the BRAC1 protein, my global purpose would be to elucidate the mechanism of breast cancer formation in humans. 
2.  What is the specific purpose addressed? The hypothesis is the question directly addressed in the experimental work.  This is sometimes includes a purpose to the experiments and often is very specific to the work.   determine the interaction partners of BRAC

For example:  This suggests that BRAC1 has only limited involvement in ASSIGNMENT  You must now begin to think to yourself what else would have to be done to get the stated result.  For example: How was the virus purified?  What type of virus was it?  What dyes did they use?  What kind of animals, if any, did they use?  Why?  Were they recombinant?  If so, how did they make?  What controls did they use/need?  Answers to these types of questions will be the majority of your write-up.  You must describe all experiments that led to the result(s) of the abstract.  We do not expect you to describe insignificant details such as your buffer concentration, but we do expect a level of detail from which one could actually design a preliminary set of experiments.  For example, if you feel you should maintain physiological pH throughout your experiments, state that and explain why.    WRITTEN SUBMISSION  
1.  Introduction:  The introduction should provide background into the   problem and briefly summarize the most pertinent experiments previously performed on this topic.  Obviously, you do not have to review the entire field.  You do not have the space or the time to do so for any of the disease topics we have covered in class.  But, include a summary of any papers on which your proposal directly builds. (~1/2 page) 
2.  Specific aims:  List in complete sentences the specific purpose(s) of your experiments.  They could include reagents to be made, questions to be answered, or hypotheses to be tested (~1/2 page).  
3.  Experiments and Expected Results:  In this section, you should describe all the experiments you plan to perform to test your hypothesis.  Try to be as detailed as possible without getting into specifics that you cannot predict.    For example, if your experiments test a new protein using the techniques described by the Prusiner lab, you could simply say, “Degradation of Protein X will be analyzed by protease K digestion using the conditions described by Prusiner et al. 
4.  Discussions and Conclusions:  Briefly summarize the purpose for your set of experiments.  Be sure to connect your outcome to the field as a whole and make predictions as to where your result will lead scientific progress in this research area.  WRITTEN SUBMISSION GUIDELINES

In particular, this work calls into question the conventional model by which the entry of the poliovirus RNA genome into the infected cell is understood. Detailed structural analyses prove that in the intermediate 135S stage, the VP1 and VP4 protein subunits of the poliovirus somehow interact with the plasma membrane of the cell to be infected, thus forming a channel through which the viral RNA can travel (

1.  BHRF1 suppresses apoptosis, is expressed primarily during lytic infection, and is not necessary for lymphocyte transformation; it appears to function primarily to prolong the lifespan of cells undergoing viral replication (
2. We will determine whether BALF1 is necessary to prevent apoptosis in EBV-infected cells.        Cells will be infected with either wild-type EBV or a BALF1-knockout strain, and the degree       of apoptosis in each case examined by flow cytometric analysis of subdiploid nuclei.  Experiments and Expected Results  To ascertain the temporal patterns of expression for BHRF1 and BALF1 during EBV infection, Akata cells (B-cell lymphoma line) will be infected with wild-type EBV and levels of gene expression analyzed by RT-PCR and immunofluorescence.  Expression will be assayed at a variety of timepoints ranging from 0 to 120 hours post-infection; this series of assays should be broad enough to cover the initiation and termination of expression of the two genes, but may be extended if necessary to give a more complete picture of the temporal expression patterns.  For RT-PCR analysis of transcriptional expression, we will isolate total RNA from wtEBV-infected cells at each timepoint using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen).  RT-PCR’s will be performed using the SuperScript RT-PCR System (Life Technologies) and primers for BHRF1, BALF1, and GAPDH (or another constitutively expressed gene) as a control.  The RT-PCR products for each timepoint will then be analyzed by gel electrophoresis.  To analyze the viral protein (translational) expression patterns by immunofluorescence, uninfected and wtEBV-infected cells will be treated with fluorescence-conjugated antibodies to BALF1 and BHRF1 at a range of timepoints after infection.  The anti-BALF1 antibody will be conjugated to fluorescein, and the anti-BHRF1 antibody to rhodamine, so that the presence of the two viral proteins can be distinguished when treated cells are examined by immunofluorescence microscopy.  We hypothesize that BHRF1 and BALF1 will be expressed at different times during EBV infection.  Since both genes are both bcl-2 homologs and function to inhibit apoptosis, it would be less advantageous for the virus to express them at the same time.  We therefore expect to see non-coinciding (but possibly overlapping) temporal patterns of expression for the two genes (Figure

1.  Time:  Aim for 10-15 minutes.  Make sure to take the time to explain everything clearly rather than worrying about how long you will take - when in class you are likely to speak more quickly. When in class, try to remember to speak slowly and clearly, and make eye contact.  However, do not plan to tell us everything verbatim from your proposal, part of the point of the presentation is for you to decide what is essential.   
2. Outline: The same as your proposal  Introduction: Tell us a little bit of background and whatever information is essential to our ability to understand your proposed set of experiments.  Outline the key questions that you wish to address.   Specific Aims: List them in complete sentences.  Experiments and Expected/Possible results: Here I find that figures are often very useful.  Explain how the experiments would be done and what you predict the results would be based on your hypothesis.   Conclusions/Discussion: Summarize your results and explain how you might proceed depending upon the results.  
3. Visual Aids: It is difficult to follow along without any visual cues.  We are a small class so you have some options.  I recommend using overhead transparencies.  If you don’t have access to a color printer, you can print them out in black and white and then use colored markers to highlight or box things.  You can also use Powerpoint and an LCD projector.  Another option is to print the figures out and mount them on stiff cardboard and we can tape them to the blackboard.  You should have all of the figures from your paper as well as some “slides” of introduction, specific aims, and conclusion/discussion key points.

1.  Introduction:  The introduction should provide background into the   problem and briefly summarize the most pertinent experiments previously performed on this topic.  Obviously, you do not have to review the entire field.  You do not have the space or the time to do so for any of the disease topics we have covered in class.  But, include a summary of any papers on which your proposal directly builds. (~1 page) 
2.  Specific aims:  List in complete sentences the specific purpose(s) of your experiments.  They could include reagents to be made, questions to be answered, or hypotheses to be tested (~1/2 page).  
3.  Experiments and Expected Results:  In this section, you should describe all the experiments you plan to perform to test your hypothesis.  Try to be as detailed as possible without getting into specifics that you cannot predict.    For example, if your experiments test a new protein using the techniques described by the Prusiner lab, you could simply say, “Degradation of Protein X will be analyzed by protease K digestion using the conditions described by Prusiner et al. 
4.  Discussions and Conclusions:  Briefly summarize the purpose for your set of experiments.  Be sure to connect your outcome to the field as a whole and make predictions as to where your result will lead scientific progress in this research area. (~1 page)  WRITTEN SUBMISSION GUIDELINES    
1.  Find a historical reference for the technique.  You should probably begin by searching Pubmed for the technique of interest.  Sort the references by publish date and look for a few of the oldest documented journal articles.  The original article(s) will be found in “techniques” journals.  Look-up and read the paper.  NOTE: most of the articles are quite old and will not be on the web or in the MIT library so I do not expect you to find them all.  Read a few of the earlier abstracts and a paper if possible and then document the citation(s) on your written submission. 
2.  You also will want to locate a more user-friendly description of the technique.  This may involve (but is not limited to) the use of textbooks or reputable web references from biologically-based websites.  Any sources you use must be documented in your written submission.  ORAL PRESENTATION  
3.  Explain in detail how the technique works.  In most cases this will involve the use of diagram and sketches.  Using hand-outs or the board in the classroom is usually sufficient, but you may use a computer or overhead projector if you prefer.  If you will need a computer or an overhead projector, please tell me in advance so I may make the necessary arrangements before class!  Your description of the method should be at a very basic level.  Remember that you are the expert in the class on this method and the presentation should be geared to an audience of novices on the subject.  WRITTEN SUBMISSION  
1.  What is the global purpose of the described experiments?      The abstract must always state the purpose of a given set of experiments including the global problem into which the research fits.  Often in the biological sciences we are working on a small facet of a much more global disease or disorder.  The global impact of the work should be mentioned as well as the hypothesis directly addressed by the subsequent experiments.    For example, if I was working on identifying specific interaction partners of the BRAC1 protein, my global purpose would be to elucidate the mechanism of breast cancer formation in humans. 
2.  What is the specific purpose addressed? The hypothesis is the question directly addressed in the experimental work.  This is sometimes includes a purpose to the experiments and often is very specific to the work.   interaction partners of BRAC
3.  What methods did the authors use to study their problem?  Often in an abstract, the experimental techniques are described briefly or not all.  Make a list for yourself of what techniques they do describe.     potential binding partners of BRAC
4.  What was their result? In my BRAC1 paper, I might say:  A yeast two-hybrid screen was used to identify For example:  Analysis of many different kinases revealed that only FAKE1 and This usually encompasses the majority of the abstract.  This is new and authors want anyone who reads his/her abstract to come away believing the result and not getting bogged down in experimental detail.   FAKE2 were able to interact with BRAC
5.  How does this relate to the original problem?  What are the implications of this result?   signaling pathway in the cell and is, therefore, unrelated to colon cancer.  ASSIGNMENT  You must now begin to think to yourself what else would have to be done to get the stated result.  For example: How was the protein purified?  How did they visualize For example:  This suggests that BRAC1 has only limited involvement in the Ras cytological changes?  What dye did they use?  What kind of animal did they use?  Why?  Was it recombinant?  If so, how did they make it?  What was the phenotype/genotype of the animal?  How was it determined?  What controls did they use/need?  Answers to these types of questions will be the majority of your write-up.  You must describe all experiments that led to the result(s) of the abstract.  I do not expect you to describe insignificant details such as your buffer concentration, but I do expect a level of detail from which one could actually design a preliminary set of experiments.  For example, if you feel you should maintain physiological pH throughout your experiments, state that and explain why. Avoid stylistic writing that expresses thoughts and feelings.  Unfortunately, as scientists, we are encouraged to be stoic and not to express our opinions unless in reference to future directions of experimental work.  Do not use “I” or “we”.  Although pronouns are beginning to resurface as an acceptable form of scientific communication, they encourage the inclusion of feelings or thoughts which are not appropriate to describe solid experiments. Your experimental design write-up should consist of 2 pages (double spaced).  You can include diagrams, but it is not a requirement and they should be included in addition to your page requirement. Your written submission must include references.  You did not invent the techniques you are describing yourself!  You must reference a paper in which the technique is used similarly or at least a textbox chapter describing it.  You may use any acceptable scientific format that includes article titles, author names, journal title, volume, year, and page numbers.  As always, you should feel free to contact me with any question or concerns you may have.     WRITTEN SUBMISSION

1) Protease as a Tool for Infection in Humans and Chimpanzees  The mucous membranes of the respiratory system in humans are a site for infection by various  Introduction  types of microbes such as Neisseria meningitides, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenza. These four species of bacteria have long plagued humans and been behind many deadly epidemics [1]. Once they get into respiratory system, they attach to the epithelial cells lining the mucous membranes and enter the body. The bacteria produce polysaccharides that coat them in a protective capsule. To counter the infection, the human body develope antibodies against the bacteria [1]. The major class of antibodies on the mucous membranes is immunoglobulin A (IgA). It is believed that after coating the polysaccharide capsule with IgA the bacteria are no longer capable of binding to epithelial cells, which ultimately decreases their ability to infect [1]. Immunoglobulin A has two different forms: IgA1 and IgA2 [2],  IgA2 has a deletion of proline residue in the hinge region [1]. Both immunoglobulins function in the same way by binding to the polysaccharide capsule of bacteria.  They are produced in plasma cells that underlie the mucosal epithelium, exported first into the epithelium cells and then exocytosed onto the outer surface of the cells [1]. Yet the difference in composition between the two immunoglobulins turns out to have important consequences.  In what could be described as an evolutionary game of one-upmanship, bacteria developed a way to counter the effects of IgA1 by producing a protease that specifically cleaves IgA

1. Concentration gradient due to a pipette tip. A pipette is connected to a reservoir of cAMP at concentration cp, and its tip is placed in a beaker of water. cAMP begins to diffuse from regions of high concentration to those of low concentration, creating a total flux F out of the reservoir; the resulting drop in the reservoir concentration of cAMP is negligible. Meanwhile, a concentration gradient is set up in the beaker, with [cAMP] = cp at the pipette tip, and zero far from the tip. The purpose of this problem is to calculate the resulting concentration profile. (
2. Cell in a linear concentration gradient The purpose of this problem is to show how the presence of a cell can influence the distribution of a chemical around it. Consider a linear concentration gradient of some chemical, specified by c(x, y, z) = c0 – J0 x.  ∇ − = ∂ = 0 c∂ t ∇ = 2 c . That is, the Hint: the diffusion equation in steady state gives concentration distribution  c(r )  satisfies Laplace’s equation. The problem is therefore analagous to one in electrostatics, with  c ↔ ϕ , and  J  ↔ E . Outside the sphere, the potential must satisfy Laplace’s equation, and reduce to a linear potential at large distances. Inside the sphere, we must add some charge distribution so that the boundary conditions are satisfied. Convince yourself that the introduction of a dipole at the origin provides the right kind of corrrection, and calculate the resulting potential.  00 ρ 0 cos(θ ) , with some α> 
3. Gradient sensing 
1. Two species of cAMP receptors exist in the Dictyostelium cell membrane: the ‘activator’ A, and the ‘inhibitor’ I, both of which act on a third protein R. When bound to cAMP, a pair of A molecules catalyzes the conversion of R to an active form R*, and a pair of I molecules catalyzes the reverse reaction (Fig. 
2. The molecule R is an enzyme known as adenylate cyclase, which in its active form catalyzes the conversion of ATP into cAMP in the cytoplasm. The presence of extracellular cAMP thus stimulates the synthesis of intracellular cAMP, which in turn is secreted into the environment, creating a positive feedback loop (Fig. 
3. When cells are grown on a plate, cAMP diffusion is slow, and the extracellular cAMP concentration is no longer uniform. Consider a plate on which there exists a uniformly distributed population of cells. Each cell senses cAMP in its environment, and secretes fresh cAMP in response. This new batch of cAMP is able to reach neighboring cells, stimulating them to synthesize more cAMP, and so on. The situation is similar to one in which a number of radio transmitter towers (cells) are used to detect, amplify, and re-broadcast a weak radio signal (cAMP). The cAMP concentration now varies over space as well as time. For simplicity, we will analyze a 1-dimensional case, with cells uniformly distributed along a line. We can assume that the cells have fixed positions over the timescales considered, because their chemotaxis is relatively slow. This system obeys the equations ∂c∂t  β⋅ i  + c 2 c 2 2=− c + D	∂ 2 c	∂x 2	∂i ∂t = c k  − i) .(We have provided MATLAB code which simulates the time evolution of a reaction-diffusion system. Modify the code to implement these equations. The system is assumed to extend from x = -1 to x = +1, with no flow at the boundaries. Use the following initial conditions: t x c ( ,	= 
4. The cells must now sense and move towards the source of the cAMP waves. It is unknown precisely how the amoebae are able convert the small front-to-back difference in cAMP concentration into the large output signal necessary to drive cell motion. However, a similar amplification of small temporal changes in ligand concentration into large changes in receptor activity has been observed in bacterial chemotaxis networks. We will now discuss a receptor clustering model that has been proposed in order to explain this amplification. Consider a receptor molecule R that is activated by the binding of some ligand L. Let α = 0,1 represent the activity of the receptor. Thus, R + L (α=

1. The Nernst potential Suppose that astronauts discover life on Mars. They excitedly bring it into the lab on board their spaceship, and measure the following ionic concentrations (in mM).  intracellular extracellular Li+ 130 60 Br– 70 200 Mg2+ 
2. Activation and inactivation of the voltage-gated sodium channel One of the most confusing aspects of the action potential is the presence of distinct “activation” and “inactivation” processes, which are both voltage-dependent, and both affect the conductance of the sodium channel. Activation and inactivation have opposite effects on the sodium conductance, and hence on voltage. However, inactivation is not the absence of activation! They are actually two independent processes. Indeed, it is possible for the sodium channel to be activated and inactivated at the same time.  In HHsim, activation and inactivation variables are plotted in the bottom graph of the main window. The m variable quantifies the amount of “activation” and the h variable quantifies the amount of “inactivation.” Both variables take on values between 0 and 
3. Activation of the voltage-gated potassium channel The potassium channel is simpler than the sodium channel, because it lacks inactivation. There is just a single activation variable n, taking on values between 0 (deactivated) and 1 (activated). The sodium current is said to be transient, because depolarization can only make it flow temporarily, before inactivation shuts it down. The potassium current is said to be persistent, because depolarization can make it flow indefinitely.  Question A (2pts): For potassium current to flow, the potassium channel must be _________ (activated/deactivated). In other words, n should not be ___ (0/
4. Action potential Click on the purple Stim1 button at the bottom left of the main window. The button simulates the effect of injecting a current pulse into the cell through a microelectrode. In the upper graph of the main window, the stimulus current is plotted as a purplish line, while the membrane voltage is plotted as a red line. The stimulus current is positive, and is said to be depolarizing. You should see an action potential, or “spike” in the membrane voltage.   Question A (4pts): Based on observation of your simulation, make a drawing of what happens to the membrane voltage, m, h, and n. Two of the variables change more rapidly, and two of them change more slowly. Which are which?   Question B (8pts): Explain why it’s important for the slow variables to be slow, in the generation of an action potential.  Now click on the Stim2 button to apply a negative, or hyperpolarizing current pulse to the cell. Notice that this also results in a spike. This behavior may be a bit surprising at first. To understand it, you’ll have to think about the voltage-dependence of the channels.  Question C (8pts): Explain why a negative current pulse is able to cause an action potential.  
5. Repolarization  Press the Channels button at the top of the main window. A Channels window will pop up. Press on the Delayed Rectifier (potassium) button. The button will change from colored to gray, meaning that the channel is disabled. Now press the yellow Nudge button at the bottom of the main window (you could also press the Run button if you like).  Question A (6pts): The membrane voltage jumps up rapidly, performing the upstroke of the action potential. Explain why this happens. Question B (4pts): After the upstroke of the action potential, the membrane voltage does not repolarize, instead settling at a positive value. What is that value? (Click on the red trace to find out.)  Explain why the membrane voltage does not repolarize.  If you would like to reenable the channel after you are done with this exercise, press on the Delayed Rectifier button again. The button will change from gray back to colored. 
1. The McCulloch-Pitts model neuron. Previously we learned how action potentials and synaptic potentials are caused by the dynamics of ionic conductances. Such dynamics were modeled mathematically by Hodgkin and Huxley in their Nobel-winning 1952 paper. But much simpler models of neurons have also proved useful for studying the computational capabilities of neural networks. The first was proposed in 1943 by McCulloch and Pitts, and captures the idea that a neuron fires an action potential when a sufficiently large number of incoming excitatory synapses are activated together. McCulloch and Pitts proposed the model while working at the University of Chicago, and used it to argue that neural networks could be universal computers. Later they moved to MIT and collaborated with the neurophysiologist Jerome Lettvin and the mathematician Norbert Wiener. Pitts was an eccentric, self-taught genius who died at the untimely age of 
2. Pattern completion by a Hebbian cell assembly. In class we discussed the CA3-specific NR1 knockout mouse that was generated in the Tonegawa lab. If the knockout mouse learned the Morris water maze with multiple visual cues present, but was tested after some cues were removed, then its performance was significantly worse than that of a normal mouse. It was proposed that this was due to defective performance of the hippocampal CA3 network at “pattern completion.” Let’s try to understand the phenomenon of pattern completion in a network of McCulloch-Pitts model neurons. Pattern completion is the Hebbian conception of how a memory can be retrieved from synaptic connections. a) Figure A shows a lot of neurons, symbolized by circles.  There are two cell assemblies, each containing four neurons. A line symbolizes two excitatory synapses between a pair of neurons, one in each direction. Describe what activity patterns could have previously created the cell assemblies through Hebbian synaptic plasticity. This is the Hebbian conception of how memories are stored in synaptic connections. Before the cell assemblies were created, you can assume that there were very weak synapses between all pairs of neurons. Such weak synapses are not drawn in Figure A; only the strong ones are shown. b) In Figure B, two neurons in one cell assembly have become active (symbolized by red). (They were activated by synaptic inputs from some sensory source, which are not shown). Suppose that all neurons are described by the McCulloch-Pitts model with a threshold of θ=
3. Will pattern completion occur in Figure B? Explain your answer. d) Now consider a more general case. Suppose that all cell assemblies contain n neurons, and all neurons have the same threshold θ. Suppose that k neurons of a cell assembly are activated by sensory input. Characterize the conditions under which pattern completion occurs.

1. Spurious or illusory correlations.   A spurious correlation occurs when two variables are statistically related (correlated), yet there is no causal relationship between the two variables.  This is usually because the relationship between the two variables is caused by a third variable.   An extreme example: A researcher collects data on all fires in Boston over the last 10 years.  They find that the number of fire engines at each fire is highly correlated with the damages, in dollars, at each fire. Should they conclude that fire engines cause the damage?

He concludes that dressing well is important for success in life. a. What is the “sample,” in this example?  What is a “population” to which the researcher might hope to generalize?    b.

3. The normal approximation. A researcher measures reaction time (RT) on a particular task, for 100 subjects.  The researcher has reason to believe that this reaction time is approximately normally distributed.  The sample mean is 10 seconds, which she takes as an estimate of the population mean.  She computes, from the sample, an estimate of the population standard deviation (using the formula with the N-1 in the denominator).  This estimate of the population standard deviation is 2 seconds. The researcher wants to estimate the probability that someone performing this RT task would do the task in under 2 seconds.  Estimate this two ways: a.	 Use MATLAB to generate a normal distribution with the estimated mean and standard deviation.  What fraction of the reaction times in this distribution fall below 2 seconds? 
4. Estimating the population standard deviation. In this problem, we’ll use MATLAB to look at the bias in estimates of the population standard deviation, for small sample sizes.  An estimator is biased when the mean value of the estimate differs from the true parameter being estimated.  (Of course, due to chance our estimates will always be off by some amount, but some estimates are better than others…) To look at bias in the estimate of the standard deviation of a normal distribution, we need to take a small number of samples from this distribution, and compute the standard deviation.  We’ll do this a LOT of times (100,

2. More use of the z-table.  What is the z value corresponding to the 90th percentile point, i.e. the z value such that 90% of the area under the normal curve lies between –infinity and z?  The 80th percentile point?  If x is normal with mean 5 and standard deviation 2, what x value corresponds to the 80th and 90th percentile points? 
3. Plot your own normal-quantile plot.  Though we have access to qqplot, it’s good to do at least one normal-quantile plot “by-hand” (you may use MATLAB, but not qqplot), to make sure you’ve got the idea.  Here’s the data: 0, 9, 2, 10, 8, 3, 5, 1, 7, 4 (The normal-quantile plot is not going to look like much with so few data points, but this is just for practice.)  Here are the steps, from Lecture 5: Sort the data.  For each data point, compute its corresponding percentile using the equation perc = (i-

9.  The range over which the normal approximation to the binomial distribution is a good one.  In this problem, you’ll be generating coin flip data and counting the number of heads, just as in the first HW assignment.  We are interested in estimating, for a given value of p (the probability of seeing a head on one coin flip), how many coin flips we need for the normal distribution to be a good approximation to the binomial distribution.  Use qqplot to judge how close the distribution of the number of heads is to a normal distribution (don’t worry about the granularity of the data – just whether it falls on a straight line otherwise).  You will just be “eyeballing” whether the qqplot says the data is approximately normal or not.  Try to be consistent, but use whatever criterion you like.  (Note that for binomial data, the line that qqplot draws is sometimes kind of bogus – nowhere near the data at all.  You may want to draw your own line over the plot, to see if it looks like the data points fall on a line.) (a) p=

This task takes an average of 10 seconds when students have not stayed up all night.   (a) The mean reaction time after staying up all night, for 30 students, is 15 seconds, with a standard deviation of 17 seconds.  Find the 95% confidence interval for the mean reaction time.  Does this interval include the with-sleep reaction time of 10 seconds? (b) With 50 students, the researcher finds the same mean reaction time (15 seconds), and the same standard deviation.  Now what is the 95% confidence interval for the mean reaction time?  Does it include the with-sleep reaction time of 10 seconds?

Let yi, i=1:ny be normally distributed random variables, also with mean µ and standard deviation σ.  Using the facts we learned about E(), linear combinations of normal random variables, and the variance of a sum of random variables, find the following: (a) What is the shape of z = mean(x) – mean(y)?  (I.E. what kind of distribution is it?) (b) What is mean(z)? (c) What is the standard deviation of z (i.e. its “standard error”)?

We will do this for the special case of 10 samples from a normal distribution with mean 3 and standard deviation 
9. A very strange game of archery.  In the archery example in class, the archer got an arrow in the central 10 cm bull’s eye 95% of the time.  The central region of the target was a circle.  When we looked at the target from the back, and wanted to estimate where the center of the target was, we drew, around each arrow, a 10 cm radius circle, and said that we were 95% confident that the true target center lay within that circle.   What if the central region were a different shape, and the archer still got an arrow in that central region 95% of the time?  For both of the following two cases, draw the 95% confidence region around the single arrow shown, i.e. given the location of the arrow, we are 95% confident that the center of the target is within what region?  (Assume the very center of the target is as indicated by the small circle.) Center of target (front view) (a) (b) Back of target.Arrow shown with“x”.  Draw the 95% confidence region. x x

Pasteurization has been used for over 100 years because it reduces bacterial load.  They take 7 cider samples from pasteurized cider, and 7 samples from unpasteurized cider.

8. Fifteen experimental subjects are tested on their driving ability in two driving simulators.  Each test involves “driving” through a mock city for approximately an hour, and the simulator rates them according to their driving ability, based upon a complicated function of reaction time, how many simulated people and cats the subjects “hit” during the simulation, and so on.   (a) If all subjects try simulator A first, then B (instead of counterbalancing so half the subjects try A first, while the others try B first), and their driving is better in simulator A, what is a possible explanation for the results which has nothing to do with simulator A being somehow better than simulator B?

1)  Draw a dorsal view of an embryonic CNS, simplified as in classes. Repeat the drawing two more times. On the drawings, add three axons of the spinothalamic tract (one on each drawing): one from the lumbar cord, the second from the mid-thoracic cord, and the third from the cervical cord. Show the first reaching the hindbrain reticular formation (and not beyond), show the second reaching the midbrain reticular formation (and not beyond), and show the third reaching the caudal thalamus. Next, answer the following questions: a.  What region of body surface could be stimulated to activate the first type of axon? b.  What region could be stimulated to activate the second type of axon? c.  What region could be stimulated to activate the third type of axon? d.  If you were to draw an axon of the spinoreticular tract, what would be the major difference from the axons of the spinothalamic tract?  
2)  The snakes known as pit vipers have an ability to detect the location of sources of infrared radiation. Describe the location of the sensory receptors. How does this ability help these snakes? Which nerve innervates these receptors? A pathway from the secondary sensory neurons activated by this nerve can be followed to a structure in the midbrain (via one more synapse).

1)  Contrast collateral sprouting of axons and regeneration of axons. KEY  Regeneration: re-growth, partial or complete, of a transected axon from, or near, the place the axon was transected.  Collateral sprouting of an undamaged axon can occur in axonal arbors in response to degeneration of endings of nearby axons. It can also occur in axonal endings of axons which have suffered the loss of other terminal arbors. In either case, the sprouting may not be near the site of damage.   
2)  Describe membrane incorporation in growing axons.  Membrane is transported down the growing axons from the cell bodies in the form of small vescicles, which fuse to the axonal membrane at the growth cone.  This also occurs at swellings along the axon.  
3)  Study the model of a growth cone depicted in figure 
4)  What is the major conclusion that can be drawn from Hibbard’s experiment on transplanted amphibian Mauthner cells of the hindbrain?  (I.e., what does his result mean?)  His result means that the substrate (the tissue of the hindbrain) contains a directional signal that determines the caudalward direction of growth of the axons of the Mauthner cells.  
5)  What is the protein “nogo” and what might it mean for attempts to promote axonal regeneration in the mature central nervous system?  Nogo is a membrane protein in oligodendrocytes. The protein inhibits the growth of axons that contact it. Since oligodendrocyte membranes form myelin, the myelinated axons of the mature CNS can be expected to inhibit the growth of axons, thus inhibiting regeneration.  1
6)  Describe an example of selective repulsion of axon growth into a structure like the optic   KEY tectum.  What molecules are involved in the case of the developing retinotectal connections?  When axons from the temporal retina grow into the optic tectum from the rostral side, they grow readily through the rostral half of the tectum but appear to be repelled from the caudal half. Axons from the nasal retina are not repelled like this, since they grow into the caudal half of the tectum.  The molecules involved are ephrins in the tectum and ephrin receptors in the retinal neurons and their axons (Eph receptors). Gradients of different ephrins and Eph receptors are found across the tectum and across the retina.  
7)  Describe several of the factors that can influence the amount of collateral sprouting of axons. Separate intrinsic and extrinsic factors.  Extrinsic factors: Growth factors (like neurotrophin molecules), availability of vacant synaptic space, electrical activity of the axons.  Intrinsic factor: The growth vigor of the axon is affected not only by the above factors but also by the total amount of end arbor the axon has formed (or the number of synapses it has formed).  
8)  Describe one method that has been used to elicit axonal regeneration in the CNS of adult animals, with a return of function.    Short segments of peripheral nerve have been cut from the leg of the animal with a brain lesion. These segments have been implanted so as to form bridges over the site of a transection of the optic tract. Axons that have been transected will grow into a peripheral nerve segment, supported by Schwann cells, grow across the bridge into the denervated tissue on the other side where they are able to form functional synapses.    A very small amount of a self-assembling peptide discovered at MIT has been injected in water solution into the site of transection of the optic tract of hamsters. The peptide self-assembles into a gel that acts as a scaffold that supports axonal growth, and the optic-tract axons will regrow across the wound and form functional terminations on the more caudal side. 
9)  Contrast two types of initiation of movement by describing a specific example of locomotion initiated from the hypothalamus and a specific example of locomotion initiated because of visual input.    Food deprivation causes increase in activity of hypothalamic cells which correspond to a strong hunger drive. This initiates locomotion necessary for foraging activity. 2
10) How is locomotion modulated by activity in structures of the hindbrain, regardless of how this locomotion was initiated? Name a descending pathway from the hindbrain whereby this modulation is accomplished.  Locomotion is modulated/ influenced by vestibular activity. Such activity activates axons of the vestibulospinal tract. [Student may also mention, or as an alternative describe, the fastigiospinal tract (cerebellospinal tract).] 
11) Contrast the structure of the red nucleus of the midbrain in two species: a rat and a monkey.   The red nucleus is made up of a rostral parvocellular component and a caudal magnocellular component. In a monkey, the parvocellular component is much larger, and in a rat the magnocellular component is much larger. 
12) Contrast the nature of peripheral synapses in the somatic motor system and the autonomic nervous system.    In the somatic motor system, the axons of motor neurons make true synapses with striated muscle fibers—each synapse affecting only one muscle fiber. In the autonomic nervous system, an axon from an autonomic ganglion release its neurotransmitter less specifically when activated by action potentials, so that it affects multiple smooth muscle fibers or multiple gland cells. This is called apocrine activation rather than true synaptic activation. 
13) Many of the dexterous movements that depend on the corticospinal tract are learned movements.  How are innate movement patterns (fixed action patterns) different?  First of all, innate movement patterns are largely unlearned. Secondly, dexterous movements of an innate movement pattern may also use the corticospinal tract. 
14) How might many learned movements depend on spinal “modules” more than on direct connections from cortex to motor neurons?  Many movements activate spinal modules that cause a hand or foot to move to a particular position in space. This simplifies learning to move the hand or foot to 3
15) Destruction of medial hindbrain pathways in monkeys can cause drastic effects on movement abilities.  Why is it that when such lesions are inflicted unilaterally, there is usually little effect?  The remaining unilateral pathway has terminations in the spinal cord that reach the contralateral as well as the ipsilateral side. Thus, there is redundancy in the pathways controlling the axial muscles, so an animal can quickly compensate for the loss of only the right or only the left descending pathway. 
16) How can neuroanatomical experiments determine whether primary somatosensory cortex overlaps fully or partially with primary motor cortex?  The thalamic nucleus VL projects to the motor cortex, and the nucleus VP projects to the primary somatosensory cortex. The anatomist can use either retrograde or anterograde tracing to find out how much, if any, of the projections from these two nuclei overlap in the cortex. 
17) How do we know that the generation of rhythmic neural activity, by whatever means, can be used to generate any conceivable temporal pattern of activity?  We know this from the mathematics of Fourier analysis, in which a waveform of any complexity can be represented as a summation of different sine waves, of different frequencies, phases, and amplitudes.  
18) What are two different types of mechanisms whereby the overall state of all or much of the brain can be changed?  
19) How have changes in brain state been measured by the recording of electrical potentials? (This is not much discussed in the textbook.)  Discuss the adequacy or inadequacy of such a measure.     Electroencephalograph recordings (EEG) show different rhythms and amplitudes when an human or animal is relaxed and quiet, wide awake and attending to novel inputs, drowsy, falling asleep, in deep sleep or in dream sleep.   Such recordings have not indicated the very large number of different brain states that the known widespread axonal projections are capable of generating. 4

2)  The brain uses much more energy than other organs of the body. How much energy does it use?  Does this mean we use much more energy when we are doing difficult problem sets? How do humans compare with other mammals? Do a search on Google Scholar or Quertle, and also on Google, to find reliable answers. (Suggested initial search: “energy requirements, brain”)  Note: In this case, Google will yield an answer that is briefer and easier to understand. Is it adequately reliable?

4) Part 5 –Internal calcium  Now you are in the position to calculate the Ca2+ flux through the NMDA receptors, and the resulting change in the postsynaptic [Ca2+] concentration.

5) Explain the qualitative differences between ICa and NMDA activation. Why is Ca flux correlated better with AMPA activation rather than NMDA activation? Why are there two spikes on the ICa trace for each postsynaptic spike?  To calculate the change in the postsynaptic [Ca], you can use a simple integrator model with a diffusion constant D (this captures both the diffusion through the cytoplasm, and the effects of buffers).

2) criteria specific to the topic of the report (how well did you address specific topics and questions in the topic area ?) The total points will be divided roughly in half between these two areas.   For each research report, we will provide a worksheet describing the details of these expectations.   We will post this worksheet  online so that you can review these criteria while you write your papers. In addition to instructor grading, a writing instructor will evaluate your first research report.   She will critique  a  draft  of  your  first  report  in  depth  for  style,  format  and  clarity.  See  the  course  schedule  for submission  dates.  After  her  evaluation  of  this  draft,  you  will  have  the  opportunity  to  take  the commentary and use it to refine the report further before your final submission of this research report. We hope that you will gain invaluable writing style tips from this evaluation that you will be able to use for the subsequent research report and for further writing outside of this course. 7MIT OpenCourseWarehttp://ocw.mit.edu
1.  For each of the following questions, give one or two MATLAB commands that answer the question, along with the answer itself. Try to make your MATLAB code short and elegant. No loops allowed!

(j)  What is the variance of the spike train? 
2.  Note that the variance of the spike train was equal to the mean minus the square of the mean.  Prove that this holds true for any binary signal. 1 ���
3.  Write a program that plots the ﬁrst 1000 samples of the spike train and the stimulus like this: noitlaudomega tlov800 600 400 200 0 −200 0 100 200 time (ms)300 400 500Hint: use the plot command to graph the stimulus, and then use the line command to draw the spikes.

The purpose of this question is to build your intuition about convolution. To that end, you may ﬁnd the “Joy of Convolution” applets at http://www.jhu.edu/˜signals/convolve/ and http://www.jhu.edu/˜signals/discreteconv2/ useful to play with. 
5.  Estimating ﬁring rate by convolution with a boxcar ﬁlter.  In the following, use only the ﬁrst 10000 samples of to be the number of spikes in a window centered at time the data. Let’s deﬁne the probability of ﬁring at time   , divided by the length of the window.  For example, in MATLAB this can be computed by convolving  rho with ones(101,
6.  Linear model of ﬁring rate versus stimulus amplitude. Again, use only the ﬁrst 10000 samples of the data in the following. Try approximating the ﬁring rate as a linear function of the stimulus. Using the function  polyfit, ﬁnd the coefﬁcients a and b such that a*stim+b best approximates prob.  Submit your code, along with a plot of a*stim+b and prob versus time on the same graph. You should see a nice ﬁt. Also plot prob versus stim (without connecting the data points) and  a*stim+b versus stim on the same graph.  This graph will show the straight line that you ﬁt to the data points.  Use the corrcoef command to compute the correlation coefﬁcient. Now try the same thing, but calculate ﬁring rate using windows of length 1001 samples and length 11 samples. Judging from the correlation coefﬁcient, which of the three windows gives the best ﬁt? Explain in words why. 
7.  Linear model of the spike train versus stimulus amplitude. Using the function polyfit, ﬁnd the coefﬁcients a and b such that a*stim+b best approximates rho. Use the corrcoef command to compute the correlation coefﬁcient, which will indicate that the ﬁt is bad. Clearly, no linear function of the stimulus can ever reproduce the spikiness of the spike train. Nevertheless, the coefﬁcients applying polyfit to stim and prob. Explain why.   and   are very similar to the ones calculated by 
8.  Calculate the autocorrelation or autocovariance of the stimulus using the  xcorr or xcov commands.  Use a maximum lag of   . Plot your result. Roughly how wide is the central peak, in milliseconds? Now do the same thing for the spike train.  Your result should look very different, with many peaks.  Explain what property of the spike train causes this.  Extra credit:  by reading the Wessel et al.  paper cited above and available on the class web site, can you ﬁgure out why the spike train has this property?

Use a maximum lag of On average, is the stimulus increasing or decreasing at the time of a spike? Explain your reasoning!   . Plot your result.

1.  Examples of convolution. In class, we studied the boxcar ﬁlter pi  = (ρi−1 + ρi + ρi+
2.  The conv function is built in to MATLAB, while the xcorr function is part of the Signal Processing Toolbox. Imagine that you are a starving grad student (a modern­day  counterpart of Abe Lincoln), and cannot afford to purchase the Toolbox. Nevertheless, your fervent desire to study the art of signal processing drives you to write your own version of xcorr. Type help  xcorr in MATLAB, and read the description of the ﬁrst invocation C=XCORR(A,B). Duplicate this with your own code.  It shouldn’t take more than a few lines, if you make use of the conv function.  (This exercise is supposed to teach you the relationship between correlation and convolution). 
3.  Show that the convolution	x(t) = dt�g(t − t�)h(t�) �  ∞ is the solution of the linear ﬁrst­order  differential equation 0 τ  + x = gdx dt where h(t) =  τ −1e−t/τ  for t ≥  0, and g(t) is an arbitrary function of time.  (Hint:  integrate by parts).  Now deﬁne h(t) = 0 for t < 0 (a kind of zero padding), and show that the convolutional formula above implies τ  + h = δ dh dt where δ(t) is the Dirac delta function.  This is why h is regarded as the impulse response for the differential equation. � j di−j sj 1

5.  Wiener­Hopf equations.  In class we discussed the problem of optimizing the approximation � M2j=M1 yi ≈ hj xi−j with respect to the ﬁlter hi. It was stated without proof that hj  is the solution of the Wiener­Hopf equations (
6.  Stimulus reconstruction from spike trains.  In class, we discussed using the Wiener­Hopf  equations to model neural response as a ﬁltered version of the stimulus.  In this exercise, we’ll work in the opposite direction:  the stimulus will be modeled as a ﬁltered version of the spike train. This method was invented by Bill Bialek, Rob de Ruyter van Steveninck, and co­workers,  and is described in Section 
7.  Compute h ∗ x. Again, the challenge here is to discard the proper elements of the convolution so that h ∗ x lines up with the stimulus y. Plot the ﬁrst 1000 elements of h ∗ x and y on the same graph. If you’ve done everything right, you should see very good agreement. Calculate the squared error of the approximation, as deﬁned in Eq. (
8.  While the preceding ﬁlter is good, the optimal ﬁlter is found by solving the Wiener­Hopf  equations (

1.  Variable interval schedule, discrete time.  Consider a single target with two possible states:  baited or unbaited. If the animal chooses an unbaited target, it receives nothing. If it chooses a baited target, it harvests the reward, and the target switches to the unbaited state. If a target is baited at the end of a trial, it remains baited for the next trial. If a target is unbaited at the end of a trial (either because reward was harvested, or because the target was unbaited to begin with), then it is rebaited according to the toss of a coin with bias P . (a)  Suppose that a target is unbaited at the end of a trial. Show that rebaiting occurs after a number of trials n drawn from the geometrical distribution P(n) = (1 − P )n−1P . (b)  Show that the average of n is given by 1/P . Note that this last result makes sense in two limiting cases. If P  = 1, then the target is rebaited immediately, so that the average n is one. In the limit P 0 the time until rebaiting diverges to inﬁnity. → 
2.  Concurrent VI schedule, discrete time.	 Suppose there are two targets, both running independent VI schedules with baiting probabilities P  and P ¯ .  Note that these two probabilities are generally chosen rather small (low overall  rate  of  reward),  so  that  P  + P ¯  <

1.  The membrane capacitance of a typical cell is 1 µF/cm2 (i.e., 10−6 uncompensated coulombs of charge on each side of 1 cm2  of membrane are needed to produce 1 V across the membrane).  Suppose that the concentrations of ions inside and outside the cell are about 
2.  A membrane is permeable to K+  and Cl−, but not to a large organic ion R+ .  Inside the membrane, the initial concentrations of RCl and KCl are both 150 mM. Outside the membrane, the initial concentration of KCl is 300 mM, while that of RCl is zero. (a)  What are the ﬁnal concentrations of R+, K+, and Cl−  on each side of the membrane at equilibrium? (b)  What is Vm  at equilibrium? (c)  Will there be any osmotic pressure? If so, in which direction? Hint: At Donnan equilibrium, the Nernst potentials of potassium and chloride must be the same. 
3.  The drawing below depicts the business end of a glass capillary microelectrode.  The hole at the tip has radius r0, and the radius r increases linearly away from the hole. (a)  What  is  the  resistance  dR  of  the  slab  shown  in  the  ﬁgure,  in  terms  of  the  thickness  dx,  radius  r,  and resistivity ρ of the electrolyte? From this result, it should be clear why the tip dominates the total resistance of the electrode. (b)  Let r = kx, so that k represents the steepness of the taper of the pipette.  Calculate the total resistance R by integrating dR from x = r0  to x = ∞.  You can make the approximation that the cone above extends to inﬁnity, rather than turning into a cylinder, which would be more realistic.  This makes little difference to the result, since the resistance is dominated by the tip. Your answer should be inversely proportional to the hole radius r0  and to the steepness of the taper k. 1 Microelectrodes1-3solutions are also doing to the potential offset of the reference electrode!

4.  The integrate­and­ﬁre  neuron is a simple model of spiking behavior that sacriﬁces biophysical realism for mathematical simplicity. Below threshold, the membrane potential V  obeys the differential equation Cm dV dt = −gL(V  − VL) − gsyn(V  − Vsyn) + Iapp (

For each case, graph the voltage vs. time, and describe in words the behaviors thatyou see.(b) You described four qualitatively different behaviors above. Find the three threshold values of the currentthat separate these four types of behavior. In other words, there is some value of the applied current belowwhich behavior 1 holds, and above which behavior 2 holds. And so on for the other thresholds.(c) One of the four types of behavior you should have described above is convergence to repetitive ﬁring ofaction potentials that continues indeﬁnitely. What is the minimum frequency of such ﬁring? What is themaximum frequency? Can you explain why repetitive ﬁring is impossible above this maximum?
3. Post-inhibitory rebound. Experiment with the following stimulation: start with zero applied current, step to anegative value, and then step back to zero. Find an amplitude and duration of the negative step such that the HHmodel ﬁres an action potential afterwards, a phenomenon known as post-inhibitory rebound. Plot V , m, h, andn as a function of time. Explain in words why this phenomenon happens.

1.  The slave boy didn't know the answer D, at the beginning of the inquiry. (85c) - he had never studied geometry in the past (85e) - he initially gave wrong answers. (egg., 82e) 
2.  He answered the questions on the basis of his opinion, i.e., he was not told along the way what to say in response to Socrates' questions. (85b) -BUT: some might object that Socrates "supplied" the slave boy with the answers, and so the boy did not find the answers, egg., D, on his own. Possible Responses: - Although Socrates provided the boy with options to consider, Socrates did not tell him what conclusions to draw.  The boy made the judgments of correctness and incorrectness on his own.  So the boy did not use Socrates as an authority in coming to his answer, but found the answer himself. 
3.  The boy arrived at the correct answer and either knows D, or could come to know D through further elenchtic testing. (85c6-d
4. 	If the boy now has knowledge of D, he must have either: a) acquired the knowledge at some time, or b) always possessed the knowledge.  (85d

(These two examples are taken from Lewis Carroll, who was an amateur logician, as well as the author of Alice in Wonderland.) The readings will usually not contain arguments in this nice form. Rather, you will have to extract premises and conclusions from much more complex and lengthy passages of text. In doing this, it is helpful to look out for certain key words which often serve as indicators of (“flags” for) premises or conclusions. Some common premise-indicators are because, since, given that, for. These words usually come right before a premise. Examples of the use of such “flags” for premises: (

Biology Can any strong claims be made about the localization of linguistic knowledge in the brain?  A review of the neuroimaging literature, patient literature, and material discussed in the course, leading to specific claims about the linguistic processes carried out by a certain area of the brain would be acceptable.  Such a paper should review what is known about the candidate area with respect to language processing, propose a theory of what role the area plays in such computations, and include ideas about what data should be sought to help determine the validity of the theory.   Some areas to consider include: Basal ganglia Broca’s area (LH) Broca’s area homologue (RH) Cerebellum IV. CHILESFor those interested in conducting their own research, and especially for those who speak anotherlanguage, you might consider undertaking an analysis of natural production data.  A paper in this area would require examining speech transcripts for evidence of certain linguistic phenomena.  Predictions should be made based on the material discussed in the course.  The relationship of the predictions to the data should be thoroughly discussed. The CHILDES database (http://childes.psy.cmu.edu/) contains transcript files for the following languages and disorders. Castillian (SLI) Dutch (SLI, DS, hearing impaired) English (SLI, perinatal brain injury- twins, autism, DS, cocaine, WS) French (SLI) Hebrew (Fragile X) Spanish (SLI, WS) V.

Please draw the tree for the sentence and show the movements that take place. CP NPi C' N' C IP D that N book wrotej  NP I' N' N VP Johnk  tk V' I tj ' ti V tj In this sentence, the verb "wrote" moves from V to I (note that I in German is to the right of the VP, unlike in English). It then moves to C. The object, "that book" moves to [Spec, CP]. The subject moves from [Spec, VP] to [Spec, IP]. It was not necessary to show subject movement from spec, VP to spec, IP - it's ok if you had the subject start out in Spec, IP. However, I did take a point off if you had the subject staying inside the VP - it's important to always have the subject in [Spec, IP] in surface structure. I didn't take off any points if you had the verb moving directly from V to C, or if you made INFL preverbal instead of postverbal. I did take off points if you had the verb precede the object inside the VP - even though this wouldn't affect the final structure of the sentence, you need to remember that German is verb-final. 1Problem (

Therefore, they have little relevance to how the human sentence processor normally operates.  If we want to know how the human sentence processor operates in normal situations, then the only types of sentences that we should be concerned with are those that there is a reasonable chance of encountering.

Show how this hypothesis would apply in processing (2a), by appeal to details of storage costs: a.

3. (5 points) Recall that in Chinese, subject-extracted relative clauses are harder to process thanobject-extracted relative clauses when they modify a subject NP:a. Chinese object extraction, modifying the subject NP “official”[ tycoon invite ti comp ] officiali  met doctor‘The official who the tycoon invited met the doctor.’b. Chinese subject extraction, modifying the subject NP “official”[ ti invite tycoon comp ] officiali  met doctor‘The official who invited the tycoon met the doctor.’(Note: the Chinese complementizer comes after the RC.) The dependency locality theory of resource use explains this preference because of the lower storage and integration costs associated with the object-extractions. What does the DLT predict will be the more complex structure when the RCs modify an NP in object position of a sentence, as in (3c) and (3d)? That is, which structure should be more complex to process?  (Hint: consider ambiguity.)  Explain your reasoning in detail. c.

1.  The number one problem is that they didn’t include a non-patient control group. Without this, they have no way of knowing that their findings have anything to do with Asperger’s Syndrome. In fact, given the other serious flaws with this experiment, it’s likely that a non-patient group would give exactly the same results (no spatial cueing effect). 
2.  Another huge problem is that the cues did not actually tell people anything about where the target would appear, so participants might have just ignored them. Since half of the cues were valid and half invalid, the odds of a target appearing on the right after a right-arrow cue was only 50/50 (same as the odds after a neutral cue). Participants may have picked up on this, consciously or unconsciously, and just treated the arrow cues as neutral cues, since they were really no more informative. (Normally this problem is avoided by having far more valid than invalid cues, ie 80% valid cue trials and 20% invalid cue trials.) 
3.  Making the target appear at exactly the same time the arrow disappeared was probably a bad idea – the sudden disappearance of the arrow probably would tend to draw participants’ attention back to the center of the screen when they should have been keeping their attention focused on one side of the screen or the other. 
4. It’s possible that participants cheated by anticipating the target and just pressing the button when they thought a target was about to appear. It would be a good idea to look at the individual RTs and see if many of them are abnormally fast (it takes some time for a signal to travel from the eyes to the fingers – subjects who respond much too quickly cannot be detecting the target; they are guessing or anticipating the target). 
5.  Similarly, it’s possible that participants were cheating by moving their eyes (however, eye movements would probably not explain these results). An eyetracker could have been used to make sure that participants maintained fixation throughout each trial. 
6.  The intermixed design might have caused additional problems in a patient population which has problems with task switching; patients might find it difficult to switch between using the cue in experimental trials and ignoring it in control trials, and perhaps they wound up ignoring the cue in all trials. I’m not sure whether this is a likely problem with Asperger’s Syndrome individuals, but might have been worthwhile to try a blocked design in addition to the intermixed. It’s possible that participants did not understand the instructions and did not feel 
7. comfortable asking the experimenter for an explanation. (The way the instructions were presented in this experiment might have been particularly bad for autistic spectrum individuals, who are likely to have problems with social interaction and language.) 
8.  The students probably should have screened their participants for other disorders, so they could either exclude certain subjects or use the extra data in their analysis. Since participants were recruited from an autism/ADHD research group, it’s likely that some participants had both ADHD and Asperger’s. The ADHD individuals might have been driving any results that showed an unusual pattern of attention. 
9.  You could argue that the participant pool is biased towards males and they should have tried to include more women in the study (but on the other hand, about 80% of the people with Asperger’s Syndrome are male, so their sample is actually very representative of the population). MIT OpenCourseWarehttp://ocw.mit.edu 
1. experiment, it’s not clear how well these results would generalize to actual real-world crime situations.  Actual eyewitnesses might be less likely to mistake bystanders for criminals because their attention is much more focused on the criminal (whereas in this experiment, the subjects might have been bored and distracted – pictures of people shopping are not that exciting).  Alternatively, eyewitnesses might be less reliable because they are often frightened and under stress.  In addition, real eyewitnesses must compare their memory of the criminal to a mugshot (which might be years out of date, with different hair, clothes, etc.), not an exact copy of the face seen at the crime scene, so the memory task really isn’t that similar to the real-world case. 
2.  The fact that one group is all psychology students (who know the experimenters!) and the other is not introduces a major confound.  The psychologists who were tested two weeks after the experiment might have made fewer false alarms because they knew more about memory or had different expectations or strategies than the naïve subjects who were tested immediately. 
3.  Counting only the false alarms is a bad way to judge memory performance.  Perhaps the group who was tested two weeks later were just less likely, in general, to say that they had seen a face before.  John needs to look at the performance on the “shoplifter” faces (hits and misses) and not just false alarms, in order to understand how people perform on this memory test. 
4.  Since the test faces are all crops from the original images, it’s possible that people were using background information from the cropped images to decide whether they had seen a face before.  (They might have decided whether or not a face was a “shoplifter” by whether the face’s background contained shop-like things like shelves, or non-shop things like trees or sky.) 
5. It’s not clear how well matched the “shoplifter” and “bystander” faces were.  If there were consistent differences between these (for example, the shoppers were mostly male, and the other faces mostly female), this might have affected the results. MIT OpenCourseWarehttp://ocw.mit.edu

1. Literature search to determine what has been done on similar topics in the past and what open issues remain to be addressed. Please include a summary of the research in your presentation and in your paper, but make sure to do this search BEFORE conducting your experiment so that you can learn from others’ mistakes and so that you don’t replicate what’s already been done. 
2. Experimental design ­ outlining the precise aim of the experiment and figuring out how the experiment will be run. Will likely involve collecting stimulus sets and possibly writing a simple computer program to present stimuli to subjects. Be creative here. You don’t have a lot of time, so if no one on your team has programming experience, you should try an old-fashioned method of collecting data. If you do want to use computers, there is a Mac lab available. These Macs have some tools that may be useful to you (Excel for data analysis, etc.). 
3. Running experiments with subjects and analyzing the collected data to test for basic trends and statistical significance. We will have a class or two on this topic. 
4. Writing the report (about 8-10 pages long, double spaced text) and preparing a 10-minute presentation. A good way for team members to divide up the work is to take the lead on one of the four tasks above. Of course, each task will involve collaboration across the entire team, but it can be spearheaded by one student. The descriptions of the experiments in class were extremely brief. In order to find out more about the topics, and to get advice on any of the steps involved in conducting the experiment, please get in touch with the TAs.

1)  INTRODUCTION: The rationale for the experiment (why did you do it?) 
2)  METHODS: The methods that were used (how did you do it?) 
3)  RESULTS: The results obtained (what did you find?) 
4)  DISCUSSION: An interpretation of those results (what does this mean?)  Although not part of a standard oral presentation, you should end your talk with: 
5) CRITIQUE AND GROUP DISCUSSION:  Your job as presenter is to not only present the paper, but also lead class discussion of its strength & weaknesses and how this work might  be  extended  in  the  future.  To  help  focus  the  class  discussion,  end  your presentation with a list of approximately three major questions/issues worthy of further discussion (see below).  
1. First, figure out what  question the researcher is asking and what answer they are giving to that question.  Ask yourself: Is this an interesting question? Does it have clear theoretical implications and if so what are they? Do you care about the result? Should anyone? Why? Are you surprised by the result? Situate the question in a broader theoretical context. If there is no such broader context, be worried.  
2. The most critical aspect of the design of the experiment is: what is getting compared to what?  Make a list of all the mental functions that you think go on during the critical test condition. Then make a list of all the mental functions that are going on in the control condition, then see how many go on only (or more) in the test condition than the control condition.   Are the test and control conditions “minimal pairs”? Be wary of very low baselines such as fixation. Beware of comparisons of a very difficult task versus a very easy task. Lots of Watch out for eye movement confounds between conditions. Imagine doing the task (or code up a version of it) and introspect while you do i. Ask:  task Y compared to what? Everything is a comparison, and many  this mental simulation. What does it feel like and what do you think you would really do in this task?  
3. Classic problems in analyses/inferences/conclusions to be wary of:  A. “Brain area X was activated by task Y.”  comparisons are uninformative/trivial.  ii. What else activates brain area X? the specific activation seen in task Y (compared to whatever) may not be so specific if prior studies have already been implicated the same area in dozens of other tasks/processes.  Two classic cases in point: the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), and the intraparietal sulcus (IPS).  iii. How strongly activated was that region? Not all ‘activations” are the same -  Effect sizes matter! If one condition produces a massive response compared to a given baseline, and another condition produces a very small but significant activation, the two  “activations” are not the same. Brain imaging is the only field I can think of where people seem to think it is OK to report p levels without means; this is completely bizarre and can be highly misleading. (Note: many fMRI researchers appear to disagree with me on this one.)  B. “Because Region X responded significantly more strongly in Task A than control, but didn't respond significantly more strongly in Task B than control, it is selectively activated by Task A.” A difference in significances is not necessarily a significant difference. If you What has been learned here?  want to claim that the region responds more to A than B, then compare A to B. Statistics are not transitive.  C. Claims of this form:  “We found activation in the medial prefrontal cortex for tasks involving reasoning about other minds, consistent with numerous prior studies.”   Brains are as different across individuals as faces are, so what counts as the “same place” in the brain is not well defined across different brains. (Is the freckle on Joe’s nose in the same place as the freckle on Bob’s nose? This means something, but it is highly imprecise. ) The prior activations for reasoning about other minds in the medial prefrontal cortex range up to 5 centimeters apart from each other. This is not the “same place” in any meaningful sense. The ‘same place” in the brain is only clearly defined within an individual subject. When pooling data across subjects, better options are to define regions of interest (functionally or anatomically) within each individual subject before pooling across subjects. Note that this is my opinion, and though many in the field agree with me, some disagree; see Friston et al (
4. Some of the many ways to cheat:A. Showing data from the “best voxel”.  of them will look pretty good.  B. Showing “fitted data”. If you have a real effect, show your real data.  C. Showing activation maps that “look similar” or “look different”. There are many ways to chose particular slices, thresholds, etc to make activations look similar or different. If the claim is that they are similar or different, this should be tested statistically on the exact same voxels. Just showing similar-looking activations (especially in group data or across subjects) without statistically testing whether the same voxels are activated, is very weak. Beware of  sneaky choice of slices; look at the anatomical images to see if it really is the same slices.  
5. Some signs of a well done study: A.  The researchers show some raw data, e.g. nonfitted time courses or at least percent signal increases  from fixation (or “beta weights”) in independently-defined regions of interest. B. The critical result is replicated at least once. C. More than one control condition is used, or the control condition is a “minimal pair”. With tens of thousands of voxels to chose from in an overall nosiy data set, some  
6. Some important general caveats about fMRI research: A. Typical imaging parametrs include about several hundred thousand neurons per voxel! Most studies smooth their data and average across subjects which increases this number dramatically. It is a great miracle that we see anything at all with this method. B. Temporal resolution of fMRI is lousy – at best a few 100 ms. Most of cognition happens in tens of milliseconds, not hundreds. So component steps cant usually be resolved. C. fMRI activations do not imply necessity!   
1. Experiment Proposal Outline Guidelines (due Oct 
2. What is the design of your experiment (what are the factors you will vary and the conditions within each)? A diagram would be helpful here. 
3. How will you analyze the data? Will you look everywhere in the brain, or will you have have ROIs? If ROIs, which ones and how will you define them?  What conditions will you compare to what? 
4. Predictions: Sketch or describe two or three of  the main possible outcomes that you may find in your experiment, and what each of these outcomes say about the hypothesis you are testing. (If  the outcomes are not relevant to the hypothesis, then you need to redesign the experiment or come up with a different hypothesis.) 
5. If you like, make an appointment to meet with me or Talia to discuss your experiment. But I expect you to have thought hard about it before you come meet with me. 
6) Your term paper proposing an experiment should in most respects be a more in-depth version of your class presentation. It should contain: 
7. References. Include a complete bibliography of all cited articles. I don’t care about the precise format of the citations, so long as the authors and then the year are listed first, you have sufficient information to find the article in a good library or on Pubmed, and you are consistent. 
1. This outline is due one day before SES #10 and will form part of your grade for the project. All of you have received extensive feedback - you should now take this feedback into account and use it to turn in a much-improved outline.   
2. On SES #10, we will not have presentations - instead, I will lecture about visual experience (scheduled on SES #12 in the syllabus).� 
3. On SES #11 and SES #12, we will have student presentations. II. Presentations There will be a strict time limit of 10 minutes of presentation and 10 minutes of class discussion for each. A. Presentations on Experiment Proposals These presentations should be very similar to the paper presentations you have already given earlier in the course – see my notes on presentations from the earlier presentations. The main difference is that you will not have data to present. Instead, you will present several alternative predictions of how the data might come out. You will then discuss how each of these possible outcomes will answer the question you posed or will bear on the hypothesis. After that you can discuss the implications of these possible outcomes, and any further control experiments you may need to do to address remaining open questions. B. Presentations Reviewing the Literature relevant to a specific research question These presentations should be very similar to the paper presentations you have already given earlier in the course – see my notes on presentations from the earlier presentations. The main difference is that you will start by explicitly stating and motivating a larger-scope question, and instead of talking about one experiment in detail, you will describe several studies more briefly – preferably each of the experiments you describe will address a different facet of the larger question. Obviously you won’t have time to go into the methods of each of these studies n detail, so you will have to figure out what the essential elements are of each of the most relevant studies. See my lecture slides from the course for examples of how to do this. A critical aspect of these presentations will be to identify any emerging consensus in the literature that answers some part of the larger question, but also crucially to identify unanswered questions that either has not been addressed in the literature, or that have been addressed with conflicting results. III. Written term Papers (Due at the beginning on SES #
1.        This result does not support the hypothesis. One possible explanation is that neither the PPA nor the LOC is preferentially activated by one class of stimuli over the other. Another possible explanation of this result is that a Type II statistical error occurred (the PPA and the LOC do in fact each respond more strongly to one class of stimuli, but our experiment failed to detect this difference). If this is believed to be the case, one might investigate the possibility that the two classes of stimuli were not distinct enough to recruit selective activation from either area. To test this possibility, the stimuli could be altered by exaggerating the concavity and convexity of the stimuli and the experiment could be rerun.  Possible Result #2      response than concave stimuli in the LOC.      This result would suggest that the PPA is not selectively activated by concave stimuli. Unlike the previous possible result, this outcome can not be easily explained in terms of inadequately distinct stimuli, since the LOC result demonstrates that the stimuli were distinct enough to recruit selective activation in that region. This outcome also suggests that the LOC is preferentially activated by convex stimuli. This may provide insight into the features of objects responsible for the historical selective activation of the LOC by objects.

Concave stimuli produce a greater bold response than convex stimuli in the LOC.        Possible Result #3          This outcome would be difficult to explain. It suggests that the PPA is not selectively activated by either class of stimuli and that the LOC responds more strongly to concave stimuli than convex stimuli. This is counterintuitive, given that objects are convex and the LOC historically has shown a higher BOLD response to objects than to any other class of stimuli.  The selective activation in the LOC by concave stimuli can not be attributed to an attentional confound. If it were the result of an attentional confound, one would expect the PPA to be more activated by concave stimuli as well.  Using a region of interest approach and an event-related design already gives this experiment more statistical power and fewer possible confounds than a non-ROI approach and a blocked design. However, if this result were obtained, it is quite possible that some error occurred, either in the experimental trials or in the data analysis. It would be advisable to rerun the experiment. At the very least, one could test additional subjects in order to increase statistical power and possibly overcome some of the 'noise' in the data.   Possible Result #4    response than concave stimuli in the PPA.   No significant difference in BOLD response between convex stimuli and concave stimuli is observed in the LOC. Convex stimuli produce a greater  bold              LOC       PPA  No significant difference in BOLD response between convex stimuli and concave stimuli is observed in the LOC. Concave stimuli produce a greater bold response than convex stimuli in the PPA.    As in the case of the previous result, this outcome would be difficult to explain. It is feasible that the LOC would not respond more strongly to one class of stimuli than another. This simply suggests that some other feature of objects is responsible for recruiting selective activation in the LOC. However, it would be difficult to explain a result in which the PPA is more activated by convex stimuli than concave stimuli, given that the PPA responds preferentially to scenes and scenes are concave. As in the last possible result, one should consider the possibility that an error occurred in the experimental run or in the analysis of the data.   Possible Result #5          This outcome supports part of the hypothesis: that concave stimuli produce a greater PPA response than do convex stimuli. This may give insight into the features of a scene that are responsible for selectively activating the PPA. An attentional confound is unlikely, as such a confound would likely produce a greater activation by concave stimuli in both regions, not just the PPA. Also, an attentional confound is also unlikely given that the stimuli share all features in common except the feature that we are testing (concavity versus convexity). This result does not support the claim that the LOC is more strongly activated by convex stimuli than concave stimuli. Given the PPA result, it is unlikely that this result was due to a confound.   Possible Result #6     Convex stimuli produce a greater bold response than concave stimuli in the PPA. Convex stimuli produce a greater bold response than concave stimuli in the LOC.      PPA           LOC    Convex stimuli produce a greater bold response than concave stimuli in the PPA. Concave stimuli produce a greater bold response than convex stimuli in the LOC.           This result is similar to the last one in that it supports part of the hypothesis and fails to support the rest. It suggests that convex stimuli produce a greater LOC response than do concave stimuli. This may give insight into the features of an object that are responsible for selectively activating the LOC. This result does not support the claim that the PPA is more strongly activated by concave stimuli than convex stimuli. In fact, it produces a response that is quite different from that which is expected and intuitive. Under some circumstances, it is reasonable to hypothesize that a greater response in both regions to one class of stimuli is due to the fact that those stimuli were more salient or complex (a confound). However, given the similarity of the stimuli in this experiment, such an explanation is not likely to be true.   Possible Result #7            This unexpected outcome is doubly difficult to interpret. It contradicts both parts of the hypothesis and suggests that either the hypothesis is completely wrong, or the experiment and/or analysis of the data was flawed.     Possible Result #8          This result would support the first portion of the hypothesis: that PPA response is higher to concave stimuli than to convex stimuli. However, it challenges the experimenter to Concave stimuli produce a greater bold response than convex stimuli in the PPA. Concave stimuli produce a greater bold response than convex stimuli in the LOC.      PPA       PPA            LOC                LOC      Concave stimuli produce a greater bold response than convex stimuli in the PPA. Convex stimuli produce a greater bold response than concave stimuli in the LOC. explain why the same result was found in the LOC. As previously mentioned, the features of these stimuli are so similar that it is unlikely that the concave stimuli could be considered more salient or more complex than the convex stimuli. Given the PPA results, it would be reasonable to hypothesize that some feature other than convexity is responsible for selective LOC activation by objects.   Possible Result #9                 This is the optimal result, and the only one that supports the hypothesis in its entirety. The fact that concave stimuli produced more activation than convex stimuli in the PPA and less activation than convex stimuli in the LOC (and vice versa for convex stimuli) suggests that there was no attentional confound.   Conclusion The current study investigates the mechanisms responsible for the selective activation of the PPA and the LOC. As such, it is at the intersection of two important lines of research, each of which has broad and far-reaching implications. The PPA is believed to be critically involved in processes necessary for human navigation, including the encoding of spatial information into memory. Insight into the functions of the LOC is equally valuable. Understanding the mechanisms by which the LOC processes object shape information is critical to the development of a full theory of object recognition. This alone has important implications, especially to the future of artificial intelligence.  Previous research has addressed the question of what kinds of stimuli activate each of        LOC         PPA     these important regions. The current study investigates 'why.'

1) a short membrane time constant, and (
2) many, weak synaptic inputs.  In these conditions, temporal coincidence of action potentials from many AN inputs is necessary to elicit an output spike, a condition that only arises at stimulus onset.  However, the model has trouble entraining to low-frequency tones if it must fire only once at the onset of high-frequency tone bursts.   It is argued that a more complex spiking mechanism is needed to produce the short interspike intervals needed for entrainment, while preventing these short intervals with high-frequency stimulation. •  An analytical coincidence detector model is used to understand some aspects of the computational model.  An important insight of this analytical model is the importance of fluctuations in membrane voltage for producing spikes, even if the mean depolarization caused by the synaptic inputs remains constant.  Such fluctuations (and therefore steady-state discharge rate) can be reduced by having many, weak synaptic inputs.

1) sequentiality of the input, 
2) discreteness of the input. Discreteness and sequentiality are first introduced in the discussion section of this paper and specific definitions of these concepts are lacking. Examples of discrete informational units provided are words and numbers in arithmetic. The complexity of computation for each of these units is affected by distance in a sentence or number line, respectively. Spatial areas are considered non-discrete as intervening elements do not exist and cannot interfere with the integration or computation. Exact calculations can occur with discrete units while only approximate calculations can occur with nondiscrete units. The difference between sequential and non-sequential information is less clear. The authors state, “visuo-spatial processing often involves non-sequential input, such that you are getting the information all at once.” How this relates to the serial presentation of spatial areas with segments of the sentences is unclear. The authors seem to be implicating that individual calculations are required in adding numbers but not in adding spatial areas. For example, “3+5” may be added up to “8”. The number “8” is held in memory and then added to the third number and so forth. Spatial information may not require these individual steps, and numerous visual areas may be held in memory and summed without intervening information held in memory. The different results in experiment 2 and 3 are claimed to be due to discreteness and sequentiality, and these concepts provide two explanations for why an interaction occurred in experiment 2 but not experiment

Also, using numbers may present other problems. Arithmetic patterns might be expected to behave like linguistic ones if they are part of the same module dealing with recursive hierarchical structure, as some psychologists believe. Even if mathematics constitutes a distinct module of its own, it may be less desirable to contrast language with it than with something involving purely semantic or real-world knowledge differences.  In any case, though, this is another type of study that could tease apart the question of language-specificity for the P
1. Introduction * My thanks to Florian Jaeger for useful discussion and his invaluable help with corpora. A  growing  body  of  literature  details  the  production  and  processing  of  the  English relativizer  that.  The  relativizer  is  typically  described  as  optional  in  English.  This optionality,  in  conjunction  with  the  polyvalence  of  the  word,  leads  to  ambiguities  in English sentences – phrases beginning with the word often may be interpreted either as relative clauses, or as noun phrases in which that is interpreted as either a pronoun or a determiner. In this study I investigate the appearance of that as a relativizer when its inclusion results, or would result, in a consecutive sequence of it and its homophone(s). A theory of production relying on altruism on the part of the speaker predicts its greater inclusion in such contexts, since this resolves the ambiguity described above. However, on theories of least  articulatory  effort  or  avoidance  of  adjacent  identical  elements  (in  the  vein  of  the phonological  Obligatory  Contour  Principle),  the  relativizer  is  predicted  to  appear  less often  than  otherwise  expected  when  it  precedes  a  that-initial  clause.  The  second prediction  is  borne  out,  as  the  relativizer  is  used  significantly  less  frequently  than expected in such contexts (p<.

This is on the assumption that plural is regularly marked – for subject  nouns  for  which  it  is  not,  the  listener  must  wait  until  the  following  verb  for disambiguation to occur.

1.  Introduction Parkinson‘s Disease (PD), a neurological disease associated with the degeneration of the dopaminergic nigostriatal pathway, is characterized by a number of physical and cognitive symptoms.  The physical manifestations of PD are well-documented, including slowness of movement (bradykinesia), difficulty initiating movement, and resting tremors.  However, the cognitive and linguistic aspects of the disease are less thoroughly understood.  This paper will focus on the language abilities of Parkinson‘s patients, particularly those in relatively early stages of the disease prior to the onset of dementia. It is a standard assumption in the PD literature that patients‘ language production is —simplified,“ with a tendency to avoid complicated syntax and especially embedded constructions (Illes et al.,

4.  Arguing in Favor of the Working Memory Hypothesis of Parkinson‘s Disease   In the previous section we looked at the evidence arguing against a role for working memory in the language deficits of Parkinson‘s patients.  However, many other studies have reported findings that are consistent with the working memory hypothesis of PD.  In this section I will review three such studies:  Grossman et al. (1992,

7.  Conclusions In this paper, I addressed the question of whether apparent deficits in comprehension exhibited by patients with Parkinson‘s disease could be attributed to a reduction in their verbal working memory capacity.  While a number of experiments have been conducted to argue both for and against this account, it was shown above that none of these studies could provide a result that unequivocally supports or refutes the working memory hypothesis.  This failure to arrive at a decisive finding can be attributed to several causes.  For instance, we observed a general tendency among these experiments to use off-line measures of comprehension, even though on-line measures are known to be more reliable.  Furthermore, in most cases we could identify potential confounding factors that compete with the experimental hypothesis to offer a possible explanation for the reported results. In an effort to correct these deficiencies, I borrowed the experimental design of Fedorenko et al. (
1.  Single neuron model First, let’s consider an isolated neuron into which we inject a current Iapp. Below threshold, the membrane potential V  obeys the differential equation C dV dt = −gL(V  − VL) + Iapp (

3.  From synapses to current In practice,  neurons are a part of networks and receive input currents through synapses instead of an electrode.  For a neuron i receiving inputs from neurons j, this can be written as: Ci dVidt = −gLi(Vi − VL) − gij (Vi − Vij ) (
4.  From spikes to rates We are now ready to derive a nonspiking model of a neuron.  To do that,  we will assume that all neurons have the same membrane capacitance C, the same time constant τ  and that conductances are changing slowly (meaning they areconstant for a small interval dt).Using the results of 1, 2 and 3, show that equation (

3.  Lateral  inhibition  and  the  horseshoe  crab  retina A simple  model  of the  horshoe  crab  retina  is  a  one-dimensional  chain  of  neurons  (considered  inﬁnite  here  to avoid  border  effects) with  inhibition  between  nearest neighbors  (see  Fig.  4a).  It  is  governed  by  the  following equation: dxi  + xi  = bi − βxi+1 − βxi−1 dt (
1) Here α  and β  are positive and denote the strengths of self-excitation and global inhibition, respectively. The function [u]+ = max{u,  0} is the rectiﬁcation nonlinearity. We will study this network in two different regimes.  First, the ampliﬁcation mode (α  <  
2) (
3) and ¯bN  is the mean of all N  inputs. In other words, the inputs are thresholded at θ(N ) and ampliﬁed by a factor of 1/(1  − α). How does θ  depend on α  and β  for large N ? More intuitively, in the rectiﬁed linear model, the positive xi are inﬂuenced by “inhibition” from the negative xi (the effect is actually excitatory due to the double minus signs). 1 		In contrast, in the nonlinear network, rectiﬁcation is an integral part of the computation, not an af­terthought. We will show that the inactive neurons contribute no inhibition to the active neurons.  It is as if the inactive neurons have been excised from the network. (b)  Global inhibition sets a dynamic threshold in the nonlinear network Now we consider the nonlinear network again. i.	 Suppose that the inputs to the nonlinear network are ordered as b1 ≥  b2 ≥  .  .  .  ≥  bN , and at least one is positive. Assume that k  neurons are active and show that there is a unique steady state where xi =1 1  −  α[bi −  θ(k)]+	θ(k)  =  β k X xj  = j=1 β 1  −  α +  kβ k X bj j=1 (
4) (
5) Hint: consider the cases xi = 0  and xi >  0  separately. This means that the gain of the common mode is 1/(1 − α + kβ). Note that it depends on the number of active neurons. This illustrates a critical point, which is that a network with threshold nonlinearity cannot be characterized by a unique gain, unlike a linear system.  Instead, the gain depends on the active set. ii.  Use this result to show that k  must satisfy bk  >β 1  −  α +  βk kbi >  bk+1	X i=1 (

Find the k eigenvalues and eigenvectors of W . Hint:  One eigenvector is the common mode 1 and the rest are differential modes (vectors whose compo­nents sum to zero). Are the differential modes stable or unstable for α  >  1?  Derive the values of β,  and k  for which the common mode is stable. 2 (b)  You should have shown that all differential modes are unstable in this case for α  >

1.  Backpropagation  Algorithm In  this  problem,  we  will  re-investigate  the  two  pattern  matching  problems from  the  previous  homework,  i.e. face  categorization  and  digit recognition. The  sample  code  for  the  last  problem  set  (perceptron delta.m) pulled  tmax images  at random  from  the  training set,  and applied an  online  update  after each  image.  For  this  problem  set,  we  will  measure  the  error  as  a  function of  epoch number,  where  an  epoch  is  deﬁned  as  a  single  pass  through  the entire  data  set  (each  image  is  evaluated  once). Write  your  code  so  that  in  each  epoch  you  cycle  through  every  image  in the  training  set  (making  an  online  update  after  each)  and  through  every image  in  the  test  set  (no  updates,  just  record the  error). We  will  look  at  two  diﬀerent  error  metrics  for  this  problem:  the  epoch squared  error  and  the  epoch  classiﬁcation  error.  The  squared  error  for  an epoch  is  simply  the  sum  of  the  squared  errors  for  each  image  in  the  data set.  This  is  precisely  the  function  that  is  minimized  in  the  gradient  descent calculation.  We  can  also  think  of  the  network  as  solving  a  classiﬁcation problem.  For  each  input,  the  image  is  classiﬁed  according  to  the  output neuron  that  is  maximally  active.  The  classiﬁcation  error  is  the  percentage of  images  which  the  network  classiﬁes  correctly. (a)  For  the  multi-layer  perceptron,  experiment  with  diﬀerent  sizes  n  of the  hidden  layer,  initial  conditions  for  the  weights  and  biases,  and learning  rate.

The  confusion matrix  should  be  2×2  for  the  faces  (binary classiﬁcation  problem) and  10  ×  10  for  the  digits. iv.  learning  curves  of  training  squared  error,  test  squared  error, training  classiﬁcation  error,  and  test  classiﬁcation  error  as  func(cid:

3) backwards  in  time  until  t  =  
4) We  will  do  that  in  2  steps: (a)  To  derive  ΔW  and  Δb  we  ﬁrst  need  to  compute  ∂Wij and  ∂R  .∂bj This  is  diﬃcult  because  R  is  an  implicit  function  of  Wij  and  b. ∂R 2 The  good news  is  that  you  do  not need to  compute  both,  because the  sensitivity lemma  tells  you  than ∂R ∂Wij = � ∂R ∂bi(t) t xj(t  −  
5.  Your  program  should  contain an  outer  loop  (2000  epochs)  and  2  inner  loops:  One  for  the  forward pass  where  you  compute  and  store  the  x(t)  and  the  D(t) for  all  T time  steps.  You  should  have  a  second  inner  loop  for  the  backward pass  where  you  compute  the  y(t)  also  for  all  T  time  steps.  D(t), y(t)  and  x(t)  should  all  be  5  ×  T .  After  the  forward  and  backward pass,  you  have  all  you  need  to  update  W  and  b. If  your  training is  getting  stuck  in  a  local  minima,  try  training  on  a  small  fraction of  the  trajectory  ﬁrst.  Submit  your  MATLAB  code,  training  error plots,  and a  state-space  plot of  the  actual trajectory superimposed on the  desired  trajectory.  Describe  in  words  the  function  of  the  hidden units  in  the  trained  networks. 3

To  help  focus  the  class  discussion,  end  your  presentation  with  a  list  of approximately three major questions/issues worthy of further discussion (see below). Plan on about 20 minutes for 1-4, and 10 minutes for 
1) The Fee paper puts forward an extremely interesting proposal about a learning mechanism in songbirds that has a clear end state (e.g., producing a song that sounds like the tutor song) and well-defined neural structures that support this learning. Not only is the idea of a learning mechanism that generates “noise” in behavior that is “biased” in a direction that is more likely to produce the correct behavior conceptually intriguing, but the precise details known about each one of these neural structures that perform these computations is amazing. However, despite its awesomeness, I think the kind of learning discussed in this paper is strictly constrained to cases where there is a “correct behavior” or a template to which the behavior is matched and reinforced. Human children’s tendency to show more variability in play when there is ambiguity or uncertainty (thus higher potential informational gain) may seem superficially similar to Fee’s birds, but their exploration gets the causal structure right even when the initial evidence observed is sparse and far from the “right template”. Part of what’s special in human exploration seems to be the ability to generate hypotheses about causal structures and perform effective interventions to yield informative evidence. The Ullman paper proposes a mechanism by which the correct can be generated via stochastic search – which seems to operate at a fundamentally different level from behavioral variability in the songbirds.  (
2) The Hayden paper suggests how firing rates of neurons in dACC may represent the relative value of (a) staying and exploiting the current resource and (b) incurring a cost to move to a different resource. In this foraging decision task, monkeys were presented with precise information about the expected rewards for staying (constant depletion 1rate) and for switching (visual representation of length of delay and fixed magnitude of reward from replenished source). While the Hills paper suggest a striking (to the extent that it’s almost unbelievable) relationship between spatial search and search in conceptual space, such foraging model in the Hayden paper seems to be way too simplified to account for foraging in hypothesis space where information is harvested and hypotheses are revised accordingly. Critically, it does not explain how humans select or generate “where to forage next”. In order to apply this framework in explaining human exploration and learning, we need to understand how value of information (e.g., evidence generated by an intervention) can be calculated with respect to the learner’s uncertainty in the current hypothesis, probability of observing such evidence, and the costs for generating such information. Despite these limitations, I think there is real potential in understanding how these variables are represented in the brain, and dACC, along with a few other areas in the prefrontal cortex, is an interesting region that may serve as the final destination where all these decision variables are integrated to generate a behavior.   Animal models of learning are important in their own right, and can explain a lot in human learning as well. However, there are at least three aspects of human learning that set us apart from non-human animals, and thus cannot be captured in these models. First, humans possess a powerful mechanism for making inductive inferences. Second, human species have unprecedented ability to represent abstract (even unobservable) variables and construct hypotheses to guide their behavior. Finally, humans seem to have the motivation to learn about causal structures in the world, which perhaps might be what makes humans most distinct from other animals.   2MIT OpenCourseWarehttp://ocw.mit.edu

A temperature-enthalpy diagram is attached. As indicated, the design heat duty for the exchanger is 1 MW. A high temperature liquid heating medium will be used to achieve the vaporization. This fluid has a constant heat capacity equal to 2000 J/kg⋅K.

1)  an applied electrical field drives the ionic polymer toward the car body, and (
2)  the passage of electrical current produces an electrode reaction at the car body which shifts the local pH and leads to deposition of the polymer. The deposited polymer is later cured in an oven. One of the problems with this process is that it requires that the aqueous solution be relatively free of any ions except the polymer and its counterions.  Excess ions of any sort simply waste current.  But extraneous ions are always present on the surface of the steel, so the procedure requires use of a process to remove these extraneous ions.  One way to do this is to use ultrafiltration membranes which retain the polymer, but allow passage of the ions and water.  A schematic showing how the process works is as follows: Paint Tank (ion source) Clean ‘Make-up’ Water and Paint Purge Water + Ions The design group which is responsible for constructing the ultrafilter has developed a schism in which one subgroup prefers small diameter ultrafiltration tubes (because they offer large area per unit volume) and another subgroup prefers large diameter ultrafiltration tubes (because they tend to offer low pressure drop). You have been asked to help with one aspect of the comparison.  Specifically, ultrafiltration tends to concentrate the polymer molecules near the surface of the membrane, and this is deleterious to performance.  Consequently, it is important to know the values of the mass transfer coefficients for the transport of polymer in the various designs. A.

Relevant properties of the flow stream and of the steam are given below. The flow rate of the feed stream is 10kg/s.  A.  What is the minimum flow rate of steam that can accomplish this task in an infinitely large, true counter-current exchanger? In an infinitely large true co-current exchanger? B.  Subject to the following assumptions, determine the area required for a true counter-current exchanger. The tube wall is very thin so the inside and outside areas are essentially equal.

It has been suggested that it might be possible to use hot flue gas to replace the steam. Like the steam, it is available at 230°C.

2)  A large fraction of all the platinum-group metals that have ever been mined currently reside in catalytic converters on automobiles. As noble metals prices rise (prices remain near record high levels) and the number of vehicles in the world increases, it is imperative to minimize the amount of catalyst employed, while still meeting the emissions regulations. Your object in this problem is to first build a Matlab simulation of a catalytic converter, and then explore the geometrical tradeoffs involved that affect the total amount of catalyst employed. The input to the converter is the car exhaust stream; when it is running fuel-rich (e.g. during acceleration) it is 1200 moles/hr of N2, 200 moles/hr of CO2, 200 moles/hr of H2O(steam), 20 moles/hr CO, and 4 moles/hr NO all at T=700 K and a total pressure of 1 atm.

5) Since no entropy should be generated in the process to minimize the required work, the temperature of the device should be regulated to be the same as that of environment (Isothermal compression). Note that work is supplied for separation and hence should be removed in the form of heat to the environment to keep the temperature constant. To reject heat while maintaining the temperature requires this process to occur very slowly. (
6) Instead of using isothermal compression, one can consider isentropic compression and heat rejection in a real situation.  As we learned from problem II in Homework I, one can reduce the required work using intercooling. If one uses a large number of intercoolings and compressors, one can bring these compression and heat rejection processes closer to the ideal isothermal process. However, this will increase the capital cost of the plant. Using 3 compressors as shown below, the required work is

4)  Most fuel cells run on pure hydrogen, or a mixture of inert gases and hydrogen, as a fuel; and pure oxygen, or air as an oxidizer.  Storing hydrogen requires either a high-pressure tank, if kept in the gaseous phase, or a cryogenic tank, if maintained in the liquid phase.  Instead.  One can start with another, easier to store fuel, e.g., methane CH4, reform that fuel to H2 and CO, and use this mixture in the cell.  High temperature solid oxide fuel cells are particularly suitable for processing such mixture.  In the homework, you will use a thermochemical properties code, EQUIL to estimate the reforming requirements, and the cell efficiency.

We  would  introduce  a  sign  change  to  describe  the  current  at  the  anode  where net oxidation is occurring.  For simplicity, we assume the relation applies to the cathode and assume no losses at the anode.  Thus,   V  = VO − IRint − 2kT e  sinh−1I 2I0, (

1) Your new proportional controller arrives from eBay.  On one end, the controller has an input port that is to be fed a signal that ranges from 0 to 100%.  Beside it is a set point knob that ranges from 0 to 100%.  At the other end is a port for the output signal, and a bias knob, both with the same range.  In the middle is the gain knob, marked from 0 to 100, and a switch that makes the gain be either + or -.   You decide to check it out on the bench.  You put the set point to 50% and supply a steady 50% signal to the input port.  You turn the bias knob to 40%, and verify that the output is 40%.

1) Read it.  It’s a long computer code, most of it commentary.  It simulates a process in a feedback control loop, integrating the equations over a period of time and displaying the traces.  Read the code to understand how this task is performed.  Notice particularly the sections marked for USER INPUT - that’s where you’ll be doing your work.  I can’t grade you on this step; it’s up to you.  But don’t rest until you are clear in your understanding.  (

3) Lesson 4 goes through root-finding and other manipulations to predict how two tanks behave under P-mode feedback control.  Let’s simplify that problem by assuming that the valve is fast, so that its time constant can be regarded as zero.  Removing this “lag term” reduces the equation order to 2, and makes it feasible to solve.  Do so.  Calculate Figures

2) “Size the valve.”  Ultimately, that means a physical size, something you select from a catalog.  However, at this point we will be content to specify the required flow capacity.  Do this by determining the outlet flow you will need to compensate for the most demanding disturbance.  Then make your specification 10% larger, so that you can avoid banging the valve fully open.  Finally express your valve “size” as the gain Kv of the transfer function between controller and outlet flow rate.  In writing this transfer function, presume that the valve is much faster than the tank, not like the one in Lesson 
3) Download the (new and slightly improved) file template.m from the MIT Server.  Modify it to describe closed-loop operation of the tank, using the equipment we have described above: process, sensor, controller, valve.  This means that you will need to code the controller algorithm.  Remember that the controller’s job is to calculate an output that positions a valve.  That controller output depends, in proportional mode, on the controller bias (xco_init), the set point (ysp), the sensor reading (ys), and the controller gain (Kc).  The subfunction argument list contains all the items you should need.  When you’ve coded things, do some common-sense checks to catch blunders.  For example, run it both open- and closed-loop with steady inputs to verify that it holds steady state.  Then run it open loop with a simple disturbance to see if the process behaves as it should.

2) Define a reference condition and recast the component equations in terms of deviation variables.  Use Laplace transforms to define transfer functions for the components.  Combine the transfer functions into a closed loop model that gives the response of T'(s) to Ta'(s) and set point Tsp'(s). Present these transfer functions in terms of appropriate gains and time constants, which are defined in terms of the physical parameters.    (
3) Recast the component equations in terms of 0-100% scaled variables.  Combine them into a single equation for the closed loop response of T* to Ta*.  Define range limits as needed.  Don’t omit factors of “100%” if they are part of the units conversion.  In each of these presentations, scrutinize your results for dimensional consistency.  Pay particular attention to gains, scaling factors, conversion factors, etc.  There should be no dimensional discrepancies.  Also, don’t forget the bias terms: with no error, only deviation variables are zero. * and set point Tsprevised 2006 Mar 21  1

An alternative form computes the change in controller output at each time.  We derive it by writing the position form at step n-1 and then subtracting.  x*co,n−x*co,n 1−=K*c(⎛⎜⎝*ε − εn*n 1−)+tΔTI*ε +nTDtΔ(2*ε − εn*n 1−+ ε*n 2− )⎞⎟⎠ This is called the “velocity form”.  The textbooks discuss pros and cons.  Our simulator can work with either; I’ve tended to use the latter.   (

1) First of all, we have a linear model expressed in the usual dynamic parameters: time constant, damping coefficient, gains.  The values assigned to those parameters depend on the reference conditions.  Compare these values side-by-side at the two stable steady-states (use the conditions specified in the spreadsheet, or find different ones, as you prefer).  This illustrates how two operating conditions might differ in their dynamic behavior, upon disturbance.  (
2) Next, use the linear model to predict response to inputs: calculate the long-term T and CA for a 20 K change in Ti at each stable steady state.  For each steady state, use both sets of linear model parameters.  Thus for a SINGLE inlet temperature change, you have a choice of 4 predicted responses.  What does this mean, and which do you give your boss?  (
3) In the long term after a step change, a new steady state is reached.  Therefore, repeat (

5) So far, you’ve calculated for two stable reference conditions.  With the nonlinear model, you should be able to start at the unstable condition, perturb it with a tiny pulse input, and see it move to one of the stable conditions.  (The linear model predicts an exponential excursion – with the linear approximation, we lose the ability to connect the multiple steady states.)  (
6) We might as well try to control this thing.  With PI control, can you keep the process at the unstable reference condition?  It may require some process and utility changes in addition to controller tuning - this is why we calculate dynamic behavior before building the equipment.    revised 2006 Mar 30  1

The zero derivative boundary condition is probably better since it will be less likely to skew a solution where you do not go far enough in the z-direction.

A key motivation for this is to avoid the production and emissions of carbon dioxide associated with the combustion of fossil fuels in power plants and transportation equipment.  To achieve this goal, a transition to a non-fossil based primary energy supply system is required.  One option is to use nuclear power for supplying all our electricity, heating and transportation fuel needs.  In this problem, you are to address the issues raised in parts a-d below in analyzing the effectiveness of three proposed approaches for using nuclear power to produce hydrogen.

6.  (15 points) The direct evaluation of the partition function for a liquid is difficult to achieve in practice.  Fortunately a range of approximations are available.  In the simple cell model for liquids, a unit cell is envisioned to be composed of a single molecule “engaged" inside a rigid lattice formed by the nearest neighbor molecules surrounding the trapped molecule.  This entrapped molecule is allowed to wander inside the cell volume (see figure below).  Although it is not possible to characterize the interaction energy of the wandering molecule by a single value, the mean field approximation and free volume concepts can be applied.  If we bring N molecules together from infinite mutual separations to form a lattice, the system loses potential energy due to attractive forces which can be equated to the “lattice energy” = ΦL.  Now we assume that all molecules are at fixed locations in the lattice, except for the wandering molecule which is assumed to preferentially want to locate at the cell center.  Thus, on a per molecule basis the attractive part of the potential energy is ΦL/N.  In general, ΦL depends on lattice spacing and hence on the volume.  Note that while all molecules have the same size described by spheres of diameter σ, the lattice on the other hand has characteristic nearest neighbor distance of a as shown in the figure below.    the liquid model.

1. (20 points) Rocky and Rochelle Jones are having one of their heated arguments on thermodynamics.  This time they are trying to reconcile the theoretical and empirical underpinnings of the so-called K factor charts or nomographs that were used during the last century, before computers were readily available, to characterize equilibrium phase partitioning in multicomponent distillation of hydrocarbons.  K is defined as the equilibrium ratio of a particular component yi in the vapor phase to xi in the liquid phase.  A typical nomograph is shown below for a set of light alkane and alkene hydrocarbons -- C-1 (methane) through C-9 (nonane),      Rocky claims that the K factors do a reasonable job of capturing important non-idealities over a wide range of conditions.  In fact, Rocky notes that you only need the temperature and pressure to specify the vapor liquid equilibrium state as indicated by the nomograph.  By connecting a straight line to a specific T and P, the intersection of that line with curve for each compound yields the K = yi/xi.    Rochelle adamantly maintains that the K’s are only based on single component information and that they fail to include intermolecular interactions.    We need your help to settle this argument.

In their scheme, pressurized pure hydrogen at 500 bar, 25oC is electrochemically oxidized with pure oxygen at 1 bar, 25oC to form water in a Fuel Cell Super Electro Converter (FCSEC) that generates electrical power directly.  CTI claims that their concept can produce more power than even the most efficient IC engine using the same H2 and O2 feeds because the FCSEC converter is not subject to Carnot limitations.  According to CTI, water exits the FCSEC at 1 bar, 25oC,  (a) (12 points) What do you think of CTI’s claim?  Back up your answer with appropriate thermodynamic analysis and discussion.  (b) (8 points) Pressurized methane, available at 500 bar and 25oC, has also been considered as a transportation fuel.

4. (20 points) Important reactions between natural minerals occur under high pressure conditions in deep underground reservoirs in the presence of water.  For many geologic systems the time scales are so long (typically years to centuries) that equilibrium can be safely assumed.  One such system is the gypsum-anhydrite-water equilibrium where  ⋅CaSO 2H O)2gypsum(4=( )s(CaSO( )4  s)anhydrite+ 22H O( )f()water In deriving the criteria for phase equilibrium, we found that the temperature and pressure of all phases were equal.  In deeply located mineral systems in rock reservoirs, fluid phase pressures can be different than solid phase pressures if the rock column above the minerals is permeable to fluid.  In other words, the hydraulic gradient and lithostatic gradient of pressure can be different.  In this case, the system has one more degree of freedom and the equilibrium distribution of products and reactants at any particular depth depends on fluid pressure (Pf) and solid phase pressure (Ps) where both can be expressed as a function of depth z.      For the gypsum-anhydrite system, let’s consider what happens over a range of conditions.  The standard Gibbs free energy change for the reaction is given by Eq. (8-

1.  In case of loss of coolant from the primary system, an equilibrium pressure between the primary system and the containment is reached and natural circulation of helium at the backup containment pressure ensues.

Since helium is an ideal gas with constant specific heat and the channel is heated by uniform heat flux, the use of channel average properties to characterize the channel flow should provide good results and allow significant analysis simplification.

Part  1 - The goal of the experiment described below is to determine the whole boiling curve from a quench test on the test section.

The pressure, mass velocity, and quality, are all quantities that can be controlled in the loop. The test section is (hopefully) long enough so that, at the center, axial conduction is not a problem.  It is short enough so that fluid conditions don't change appreciably at its center during the transient.  It  is thick enough so that the transient is sufficiently slow that the thermocouples welded to the outside give a fair measure of  the inside temperature.  It is thin enough so that -	 (hopefully) the error in extrapolating the  temperature from the outside to the inside is acceptable. In  order to  run this experiment the loop pressure, flow, and inlet temperature are fixed.  The power to  the preheater is set giving a known and controllable quality at the teat section.

1.  SPECIFIC  AIMS 2 The  importance  of  developing  eﬀective  cancer  treatment  protocols  is  increasingly  important, as  cancer  mortality  has  remained  relatively  constant  over  the  past  few  decades.  In  contrast,  the mortality  of  other  diseases,  such  as  heart  disease,  cerebrovascular  disease,  pneumonia,  and  in­ﬂuenza,  has  dropped  by  more  than  50%  in  each  case.  However,  current  treatments  of  cancer  can be  improved  signiﬁcantly,  through  the  application  of  relatively  new  concepts  in  tumor  biology.  The general  goal  here  is  to  apply  some  of  those  concepts  to  radiation  therapy,  in  hopes  of  signiﬁcantly sensitizing  tumors  to  fractionated  radiation  therapy,  while  not  aﬀecting  the  radiosensitivity  of  nor­mal  tissue.  In  pursuit  of  this  general  goal,  the  aim  here  is  to  determine  whether  the  brief  window of  vascular  normalization,  as  caused  by  antiangiogenic  agents,  augments  the  tumor  radiosensitivity caused  by  HIF­1  inhibition,  and  vice­versa.

3.  Action  of  Radiation  Therapy As  mentioned  above,  the  accepted  mechanism  of  action  of  radiation  therapy  has  changed  in recent  years.  Several  studies  have  suggested  that  radiation  therapy,  when  combined  with  the  ad­ministration  of  antiangiogenic  drugs,  results  in  a  greater  than  additive  increase  in  the  eﬀectiveness of  the  anti­tumor  radiotherapy  [3,  5,  7].  These  studies  revealed  a  link  between  the  tumor  and  its microvasculature  that  was  previously  unknown. Recent  research  suggests  that  radiation  therapy  causes  damage  to  tumors  by  targeting  tumor microvasculature,  rather  than  tumor  cells  [10].  The  prevailing  hypothesis  before  this  research  held that  permanent  radiation  damage  to  tumors  resulted from  reproductive  cell  death,  caused  by direct, cytotoxic  irradiation  of  tumor  stem  cell  clonogens.  However,  it  has  been  shown  that,  after  single­dose  irradiation  of  a  tumor,  the  endothelial  cells  (ECs)  of  the  microvasculature  induce  surrounding cells  to  apoptize  via  ceramide  and  ASMase  signaling [13,  19].  For  example,  in  gastrointestinal studies  [13,  19],  it  has  been  shown  that,  when  ceramide  signaling  is  enhanced  by  the  inhibition of  ATM  kinase  (a  repressor  of  ceramide  synthase),  post­irradiative  stem  cell  clonogen  survival  is signiﬁcantly  decreased.  This  EC­based  sensitization  of  crypt  stem  cells  is  supported  by  other  GI experiments  [8]:  pretreatment  of  cells  with  bFGF  reduces  EC  apoptosis,  and  thus  increases  stem cell  clonogen  survival;  deletion  of  Smpd1,  a  gene  ecnoding  the  apoptosis  mediating  factor  ASMase, also  results  in  attenuation  of  EC  apoptosis  (and  stem  cell  clonogen  death).  While  ceramide  and ASMase  signaling  play  very  important  roles  in  the  response  of  a  tumor  to  single­dose  radiotherapy, Moeller  et  al.  revealed  another  important  factor  in  the  regulation  of  tumor  response  to  fractionated radiotherapy. 6 In  recent  studies,  Moeller  et  al. [14]  showed  that  fractionated  radiotherapy  induces  a  radio­protective  eﬀect  on  the  tumor  vasculature  through  the  action  of  HIF­
4.  HIF­1  Blockade  Aﬀects  Tumor  Radiosensitivity Following  up  on  their  hypothesis,  Moeller  and  colleagues  tested  the  eﬀects  of  HIF­1  blockade on  tumor  radiosensitivity  [20].  Because  the  role  played  HIF­1  is  very  complex  role  and  involves  the regulation  several  diﬀerent  phenotypes,  Moeller  et  al.  [20]  sought  to  determine  the  overall  eﬀect  of HIF­1  blockade  on  the  radiosensitivity  of  tumor  cells  and  tumor  vasculature.  They  found  that  HIF­1  promotes  tumor  vessel  radioresistance,  and  that  HIF­1  inhibition  dramatically  increases  tumor 7 vasculature  radiosensitivity,  regardless  of  whether  inhibition  occurs  before  or  after  irradiation. With  regard  to  central  tumor  cells,  which  are  hypoxic  and  have  slowed  metabolism,  HIF­1  acts  to maintain  glucose  metabolism  and  ATP  production  ­ thus,  the  inhibition  of  HIF­1  decreases  central tumor  cell  bioenergetics.  In  fact,  this  eﬀect  is  signiﬁcant  enough  that  HIF­1  inhibition  ends  up protecting central  tumor  cells  from  ionizing  radiation  through  causing  a  reduction  in  their  cellular activity.  Furthermore,  the  Moeller  et  al.  research  suggests  that  HIF­1  promotes  cell  cycle  arrest  in hypoxic  tumor  cells  that  have  access  to  glycolytic  energy  stores,  indicating  that  HIF­1  inhibition might  radiosensitize  these  cells  through  encouraging  post­irradiative  mitosis.  In  cells  that  are  both glucose  and  oxygen  starved,  HIF­1  increases  cellular  radiosensitivity  by  sustaining  mitotic  rates; consequently,  HIF­1  inhibition  would  be  radioprotective  in  these  “distal”  tumor  cells.  As  it  can  be seen,  the  ultimate  eﬀect  of  HIF­1  blockade  on  cellular  radiosensitivity  is  highly  dependent  on  the surrounding  microenvironment. In  conducting  the  research  described  above,  Moeller  et  al.  also  found  that  the  eﬀect  that  HIF­1  inhibition  has  on  tumor  cells  is  primarily  due  to  the  cells’  immediate  response  to  irradiation. Therefore,  administering  HIF­1  inhibitor  after  exposing  a  tumor  to  IR  would minimizing  the  pos­sible  radioprotective  eﬀects  on  the  tumor  interior.  In  contrast,  such  timing  would  not  change  the eﬀect  that  HIF­1  inhibition  has  on  the  tumor  vasculature  (as  mentioned  above).  Thus,  Moeller et  al.  recommend  a  radiation­ﬁrst  approach  to  augmenting  radiotherapy  with  HIF­1  inhibition. However,  this  conclusion  is  based  on  experiments  performed  with  constant,  unaltered  tumor  mi­croenvironments. 
5.  Alteration  of  Tumor  Microenvironment  Through  Vascular  Normalization A  relatively  new  concept  in  cancer  biology  is  the  normalization  of  a  tumor’s  vasculature  in response  to  antiangiogenic  drugs.  Conventional  belief  regarding  antiangiogenic  therapy  is  that the  administration  of  angiogenesis  inhibitors  results  in  the  destruction  of  a  tumor’s  vasculature. Consequently,  the  tumor  is  starved  of  oxygen  and  nutrients  and  cannot  grow  or  survive.  However, recent research suggests  that,  in  the  course  of  destroying  tumor  vasculature,  certain  antiangiogenic agents  can  actually  cause  the  vasculature  to  become  more  “normal”  and  eﬃcient  at  delivering nutrients  for  a  brief  period  of  time  [17]. In  brain  tumors,  this  was  shown  to  happen  through increased  pericyte  coverage  and  a  corresponding  activation  of  matrix  metalloproteinases  [16].  The transient  normalization  provided  by  antiangiogenic  agents  can  alleviate  the  hypoxic  environment of  tumors  and  also  allow  for  improved  drug  delivery  to  the  tumor  interior.  Thus,  it  has  become 8 increasingly  apparent  that  the  window  of  normalization  provided  by  antiangiogenic  agents,  such  as VEGFR­2  antibody  and  thalidomide,  can  be  used  to  optimize  the  response  of  tumors  to  cytotoxic therapies  [15,  18].  Because  vascular  normalization  alters  the  microenvironment  of  a  tumor,  it  might also  help  to  maximize  tumor  radiosensitivity  in  response  to  HIF­1  blockade. 
6.  Vascular  Normalization  combined  with  HIF­1  Blockade As  mentioned  earlier,  the  eﬀect  of  HIF­1  on  tumor  cells  is  highly  dependent  on  the  surround­ing  tumor  microenvironment.  To  summarize,  HIF­1 enhances  tumor  radiosensitivity  in  nutrient­starved,  distal  tumor  cells  through  promoting  apoptosis,  metabolism,  and  proliferation  of  these cells.  However, in  the  tumor  vasculature,  HIF­1  decreases  radiosensitivity  through  cytokine­mediated  cell  protection [20].  Many  of  the  experiments  performed  by  Moeller  et  al.  in  investigating the  pleiotropic  eﬀects  of  HIF­1  blockade  involved  in  vitro  cell  cultures.  While  the  experiments  do yield  signiﬁcant  insight  into  various  eﬀects  of  HIF­1  blockade,  they  do  not  readily  suggest  what might  happen  in  changing  tumor  microenvironments  in  vivo. One  way  to  alter  the  in  vivo  tumor  microenvironment  is  to  normalize  the  tumor  vasculature. As  discussed  above,  this  can  be  done  through  careful  application  of  antiangiogenic  therapy. In combining  this  approach  with  HIF­1  blockade,  it  is  hypothesized  that  the  alleviation  of  hypoxia resulting  from  vascular  normalization  will  decrease  the  radioprotective  eﬀects  that  HIF­1  inhibition has  on  the  distal  tumor  cells.  It  is  also  hypothesized  that  the  increased  tumor  oxygenation  prior to  radiotherapy  will  result  in  an  increased  level  of  oxidative  stress  in  the  post­irradiative  tumor microenvironment.  This  stress  would  stabilize  the  active  form  of  HIF­1,  making  HIF­1  inhibition all  the  more  useful  when  a  vasculature­normalized  tumor  is  treated  with  fractionated  radiotherapy. As  mentioned  in  section  
7.  DC101  treated  mice  from  each group  will  be  exposed to  HIF­1  inhibitor  without  radiotherapy. This  experiment  will  be  used  to  determine  if  the  eﬀects  of  HIF­1  inhibition  are  coupled  to radiotherapy  ­ it  is  expected  that  this  will  be  the  case,  since  HIF­1  activation  is  largely dependent  on  the  radiation­induced  microenvironment. 
8.  DC101  treated  mice  from  each  group  will  be  exposed  to  fractionated IR  and  HIF­1  inhibition. Here,  as  in  the  fourth  experiment,  HIF­1  inhibition  will  be  administered  before  radiotherapy 11 in  some  mice,  and  after  radiotherapy  in  others.  This  is  the  ﬁnal  experiment  needed  to  test the  hypothesis  that  vascular  normalization,  fractionated  radiotherapy,  and  HIF­1  inhibition produce  a  greater­than­additive  delay  in  tumor  growth. In  this  series  of  experiments,  each of  the  three  treatment  variables  (VEGFR­2 antibody,  fraction­ated  IR  therapy,  HIF­1  inhibitor)  is  tested  in  every  possible  combination  with  the  other  variables. The  results  from  these  experiments  will  determine  if  the  eﬀect  of  combining  vascular  normalization with  HIF­1  inhibition  results  in  a  greater­than­additive  sensitization  to  IR.  The  experiments  will allow  for  a  comparison  of  the  model  being  used  against  previously  published  results.  They  will also  provide  the  data  necessary  to  determine  if  any  of  the  observed  eﬀects  are  due  to  the  coupling of  two  of  the  three  treatments,  rather  than  the  hypothesized  interplay  of  all  three. In  addition  to  measuring  the  eﬀect  of  the  various  treatment  combinations  on  tumor  growth delay,  tumor  oxygenation,  perfusion,  and  interstitial  ﬂuid  pressure  (IFP)  will  be  measured.  The purpose  of  these  measurements  is  to  check  if  vascular  normalization  is  occurring,  and  if  the  tumor microenvironment  is  changing  as  a  result.  Vascular  normalization  should  result  in  an  observable increase  in  tumor  pO2  and  vascular  perfusion,  and  a  decrease  in  IFP.  In  order  to  obtain  this  data, a  measurement  protocol  similar  to  that  of  Ansiaux  et  al. [18]  will  be  followed: •	 Electronic  paramagnetic  resonance  (EPR)  oximetry will  be  used  to  measure  changes  in  tumor oxygenation. •	 Tumor  perfusion  will  be  measured  using  dynamic  contrast­enhanced  magnetic  resonance imaging. •	 IFP  will  me  measured  using  a  polyurethane  transducer­tipped  catheter  [21].

However,  the  standard  wick­in­needle approach may  prove  to  be  a  better  option,  due  to  its  widespread  use  and  acceptance.

1.  Abstract:  Antiangiogenic cancer treatments recently achieved a major clinical success with the announcement that Avastin, an antibody specific to vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), significantly improves the efficacy of chemotherapy in treating first line colorectal, lung, and breast cancer patients [1, 2].  The synergistic effect of adding Avastin to traditional chemotherapy has been explained by the concept of vascular normalization in which antiangiogenic therapy improves delivery of cytotoxic agents by “normalizing” the morphology and function of aberrant tumor vasculature.  Vascular changes induced during normalization include decreased vessel density, diameter, and tortuosity, increased pericyte coverage, decreased permeability, reduced interstitial fluid pressure (IFP), increased oxygen tension (pO
2.  Specific Aims:  Specific Aim 1: Determine if PTK787 administration induces normalization of tumor vasculature.  PTK787 will be administered daily to mice containing xenografts of human colorectal cancer cells.  The tumor vasculature will be examined for morphological and functional markers of normalization including measurements of vessel density, diameter, and tortuosity, pericyte coverage, vascular permeability, interstitial fluid pressure, oxygen tension, and macromolecular extravasation.  These measurements will be repeated at multiple time points to produce a comprehensive kinetic model of PTK787 induced vascular changes.  Specific Aim 2:  Determine if PTK787 induced inhibition of PDGF signaling reduces normalization by blocking pericyte recruitment.  Mice will be administered a PDGF specific inhibitor in conjunction with an anti-VEGF antibody to see if blocking PDGF mediated recruitment of pericytes eliminates the previously observed normalization in response to VEGF specific inhibition.  Similarly, PTK787 treated mice will be administered a synthetic analogue of the pericyte inducing factor S1P to determine if improved pericyte recruitment is able to enhance vascular normalization in response to the tyrosine kinase inhibitor.     Specific Aim 3:  Broadly characterize molecular changes induced by PTK787 in the tumor vasculature using a gene chip array.  Tumors from PTK787 treated and control mice will be excised, homogenized, and their mRNA analyzed on a gene chip array containing cDNA for common pro- and anti-angiogenic factors.  Statistical analysis will be utilized to determine factors that show significantly altered expression profiles following PTK787 treatment.  siRNA or other knockout techniques may then be utilized to determine if selected factors play a functional role in regulating the degree of tumor normalization.

The reason is that the transition state for this isomerization reaction is a singlet diradical. You have to treat it specially, otherwise, you will not be able to get the right transition state. Please refer to the following procedures about how to get the correct transition state (The input files will also be posted on website).

Before you submit the jobs, make sure you have the following files in your home directory (Of course you can put them to different folders and then specify the directory of different folder in your job script).

2. Two-Slit Experiment  A.  What would happen in the 2-slit experiment if the light source was not monochromatic?  B.  Would the interference pattern observed in the 2-slit experiment be affected if the light source is constantly moving forward and back behind the 2-slit assembly while the sequence of single-event dots is being recorded on the detector screen?  C.  D.  E.     Normally, in the 2-slit experiment, both slits are exposed to the same radiation intensity. What would the pattern on the screen look like if a neutral density filter were used to reduce the intensity of light hitting slit #2 by 50%?  Sketch or describe in two short sentences. Suppose each slit is equipped with a square wave shutter (i.e. instantaneous open, instantaneous close) and these shutters operate perfectly out-of-phase.  Always, when one is open, the other is closed.   (i)  Will there by any interference pattern?  (ii) Suppose the frequency of the shutter pair is increased to such a high frequency that its open time corresponds to the time required for a photon to travel a distance equal to 1/2 of its wavelength. [This is an unreasonably short time, but possible in principle.]  Will there be any change in what is recorded on the detector screen as the shutter frequency is increased?  Discuss.  Suppose an acousto optic modulator (AOM) is attached to the back side (i.e., toward the source) of one of the slits. The AOM shifts the frequency of the transmitted radiation by ωAOM, ω = ω0 + ωAOM. There is no frequency dependence of the response of the screen to the radiation incident on it. (i)  What kind of pattern will be recorded on the detection screen?

1.  / Later in the course, we will find a very useful connection between quantum mechanical eigenvalue problems and matrix eigenvalue problems.  To prepare for that, we want to practice using a computer to solve a not-so-simple matrix eigenvalue problem. Use your favorite software package to compute the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the following matrix: 0 β ⎞⎛ α β 0⎜ β α β β0 ⎟⎜⎟⎜ 0 β α β 0 ⎟  ⎜⎟⎜ 0 β β α β ⎟⎜⎝ β 0⎟β α ⎠0Be careful to make sure your eigenvectors are orthonormal.

[Note: if you use Matlab, it will prove useful to write each of these matrices as α times the identity matrix plus β times another matrix. Call this other matrix M. You will then need to convince yourself that the eigenvectors of the full matrix are the same as the eigenvectors of M.]   
2.   As you have been taught in your earlier chemistry classes, the s and p orbitals are not the most appropriate way to think about atomic orbitals in, say, methane.

3.  /  In this problem we want to approximate the strength of a two electron bond between two atoms (A and B) with different electronegativities. Approximate the molecular orbitals as linear combinations of one valence orbital on A and another on B For simplicity, assume that the atomic orbitals are approximately orthogonal  ψ ≡ c1φA + c2φB  S ≡ ∫φAφB dτ≈ 0 . a.  We now want to approximate the energy of the AB bond for a fixed atom A bonding to different partners B with varying electronegativity. To this end, Fix the electronegativity of atom A (εA) and allow the electronegativity of B (εB) to vary freely. Finally, assume the coupling matrix element is independent of the electronegativity and (arbitrarily) equal to 1 V ≡ ∫φAHˆφB dτ≈ 1 Within this model, compute the binding energy of the lowest MO as a function of εB. That is to say, compute the difference in energy between the lowest MO and the lowest AO as you vary the electronegativity of atom B.  What electronegativity produces the strongest AB bond?  Does this agree with your chemical intuition? You may wish to look up a few A-B bond strengths to substantiate your argument. b.  The model above is missing electron-electron interactions.  Qualitatively speaking, how would you expect  the results of part a. to  2 change if you included electron-electron interactions at the level of the independent particle model (IPM)? Be as specific as you can in your answer. For example, will the bond get stronger or weaker?  Will the optimal electronegativity change?

5.     Unsaturation (i.e. the existence of stable multiple bonds) is an extremely important phenomenon for the chemistry of carbon.  However, it is comparatively rare for silicon even though C and Si have the same valence shell.  In this problem, we develop an explanation for this based on MO theory.  Consider the ethylene molecule (H2C-CH
1.  n/ This problem considers the Hückel MO theory of π-conjugated systems.  To answer each question, you will need to construct the Hückel MOs for each of the molecules pictured, divide them into sets of occupied and unoccupied orbitals and determine the relevant properties, such as ground state energy, bond order, etc.  a.  Determine the electron affinity of benzene [IP=E(B-)-E(B)].  Compare this to the EA of hexatriene.  Which is more electrophillic?  Versus b.

2.  n/  It is straightforward to extend Huckel Theory to deal with π systems containing elements besides carbon and hydrogen. a.  First, let us consider including heteroatoms such as nitrogen inside of conjugated rings.  To use the Huckel prescription, we simply need α values for C and N and β values for CC and CN bonds.  We already know that α(C)=-

5.  n/ One of the most important intermolecular interactions in chemistry is the hydrogen bond. In particular, hydrogen bonding in water is an extremely important topic.  In this problem, we will study the hydrogen bond between two water molecules. a.  Compute the length, R, of a hydrogen bond between two water molecules using B3LYP in a 6-31G(d,p) basis.  To do this, you will need to optimize the geometry of a pair of water molecules placed close to one another: ROHOHHH How does the length of the H--O hydrogen bond compare to the O-H bond in water?  b.  Now, compute the binding energy of the hydrogen bond using B3LYP/6-31G(d,p): ΔE=E(2 H2O)-2 E(H2O) How does the strength of the hydrogen bond compare to the strength of an OH-bond in water? c.

6)  (10 points) Consider the MO picture of bonding in Cr
7)  (4 Points) What is the Born Oppenheimer Approximation? The Born Oppenheimer approximation is the physical observation that, because the nuclei are much heavier than the electrons, they move more slowly. As a result, we can think of the electrons as moving in the field arising from the fixed nuclei. We can therefor separate the electronic and nuclear parts of the wavefunction and retain a semi-classical picture of the atomic positions.  11/29/12 Exam III   5

After emission, denote the basis states of the two photons by: �θk1,θ;k � �where  ki  is the wavevector (direction of propagation) of photon i and θa.

2.  The infrared rotational-vibrational spectrum of a diatomic Let’s study the correlation function for the rotational-vibrational infrared absorption spectrum of a heteronuclear diatomic molecule.  We are considering the transitions induced by infrared light that is resonant with a vibrational transition with frequency much greater than kT, and the frequency of the infrared light is much higher frequency than the splitting between rotational levels. We will use the harmonic oscillator and rigid rotor Hamiltonians to describe the vibrational and rotational degrees of freedom: H0  = Hvib  + Hrot H  = vib H  = rot p2 2M R L22I 1 kq+ 22  = hΩ ⎛ n + 0 ⎜⎝ 1 ⎞  2 ⎟⎠ I = M RR2Here where  M R  is the reduced mass and q is the vibrational coordinate. I is the moment of inertia, which is related to the rotational constant by  B = h / 4π Ic .  So, the state of the system will be described by three quantum numbers  n J M   . The diatomic will interact with the light through the transition dipole moment.  Since we assume that there are no interactions between the vibrational and rotational degrees of freedom, we will also partition the dipole operator into two parts: μ= μˆ m where μˆ is a unit vector oriented along the transition moment (and along the vibrational coordinate in this case), and m is the magnitude of the dipole moment, which we take to be a weak function of the nuclear coordinate: m m= 0 + ⎜ ⎛ ∂m ⎞ ⎟  q⎝ ∂q ⎠q0  = m0 + m q1 m0 is the magnitude of the permanent dipole moment and  m1 is the amplitude of the transition dipole moment.

2. Vibrational relaxation in a triatomic We’ll  examine  the  process  of  vibrational  relaxation  commonly  found  in  triatomic  molecules, focusing specifically at the case of water. For the case of a nonlinear “ABA” molecule such as H2O, the normal modes of vibration are the symmetric and asymmetric O-H stretching modes, νa and νs, and  the  bending  mode,  δHOH,  with  vibrational  frequencies  of  ωa0=3450  cm-1,  ωs0=3200  cm-1  and ωb0=1650 cm-1, respectively. The splitting between νa and νs arises from coupling between the two OH local mode stretching vibrations.  In the case of the nonlinear “ABC” molecule HDO (where D is 2H), the normal modes are well-approximated by local O-H and O-D stretching vibrations, νh and νd,  and  the  bend  is  δHOD.  The  frequencies  in  this  case  are  ωh0=3400  cm-1,  ωd0=2500  cm-1  and ωb0=1450 cm-1, respectively. dissipates to vibrations For  both  H2O  and  HOD,  the  dominant mechanism  by  which  vibrational  energy  in stretching the environment  is  through  stretch-bend  coupling. An  anharmonic  coupling  exists  by  which vibrational energy flows from the stretch to the v=2  state  of  the  bend  (bend  overtone).  That  is, annihilation  of  one  quantum  of  stretch  leads  to two quanta in the bend.  The energy difference is made  up  by  the  bath.  We  will  be  investigating this  vibrational  energy  transfer  process  treating the  bend  overtone  as  a  sink  for  vibrational energy  in  the  stretches.  For  our  purposes,  we take the energy of the bend overtone states to be ωb=3250  cm-1  and  ωb=2900  cm-1  for  H2O  and HOD respectively. The values of the couplings V between the stretches and bend overtones are as follows.  In the case of H2O, the bend overtone has the same symmetry as the symmetric state, leading to strong mixing in comparison to the asymmetric state.  Let’s take Vab= 15 cm-1 and Vsb= 50 cm-

For  a  weakly  anharmonic oscillator,  we  will  have  only  a  very  small  shift  between  the  0 fundamental transition frequency ω10 = Ω and the n=1→2 transition, ω21=Ω−δΩ. ω21= Ω−δΩ ω10 = Ω We want to describe the behavior of two experiments shown here.

2.  Vibrational Excitation by a Shock Wave.  We are going to study the excitation of higher lying vibrational levels of an anharmonic potential that would occur in a molecular crystal or liquid subjected to an shock wave. A strong shock wave in a molecular crystal could be launched by applying an abrupt pressure of 5 GPa, launching a shock wave that travels at about 5 nm/ps, leading to the compression of a solid by about 20%.  The compression can lead to vibrational excitation and heating of molecules in the shock zone, which can induce chemical reactions (like detonation of explosives).  We will study a simplified model that captures the effects of such an excitation.  We will partition the Hamiltonian as  ( )H H V t(
3) ˆ⋅( )=( )t Here f(t) is the normalized time-profile of the shock wave and A is an amplitude factor that describes the strength of coupling of the shock wave to the oscillator.

The time dependent Hamiltonian for this problem could be written in terms of the Hamiltonians for the atom and for the electron, as well as a time-dependent interaction between them interaction mixes the atomic eigenstates. This is an appropriate picture if |V(t)|<<|Hatom|.  To just consider the induced changes to the electronic wavefunction of the atom, we will write   .  Let’s consider how a weak H HH H( )V t(

We will assume that we prepare the atom at t = −∞ in the 1s orbital [b1s(−∞) = 1] and follow time dependent interactions that couple the 1s state to the n = 2 states. This would hold for relatively large impact parameters, so we will assume that the separation of the free electron from He+ nucleus and the He+ electron are approximately equal:   Rtake the frame of reference to be the atomic nucleus.

1. The IR rotational-vibrational spectrum of a diatomic Let’s study the correlation function for the rotational-vibrational infrared absorption spectrum of a heteronuclear diatomic molecule.  We are considering the transitions induced by infrared light that is resonant with a vibrational transition with frequency much greater than kT, and the frequency of the infrared light is much higher frequency than the splitting between rotational levels. We will use the harmonic oscillator and rigid rotor Hamiltonians to describe the vibrational and rotational degrees of freedom: H0  = Hvib  + Hrot H vib  = Hrot  = p 2 2M R L2 2I+ 1 kq2 1  2  = =Ω 0   n + 2 I = M R2 R Here where  M R  is the reduced mass and q is the vibrational coordinate. I is the moment of inertia, which is related to the rotational constant by  B = = / 4π Ic .  So, the state of the system will be described by three quantum numbers  n J  M   . The diatomic will interact with the light through the transition dipole moment.  Since we assume that there are no interactions between the vibrational and rotational degrees of freedom, we will also partition the dipole operator into two parts: ˆ mµ= µ where  ˆµ is a unit vector oriented along the transition moment (and along the vibrational coordinate in this case), and m is the magnitude of the dipole moment, which we take to be a weak function of the nuclear coordinate: m m0 += ∂ m ∂ q  0 = m0 + m  q1 q m0 is the magnitude of the permanent dipole moment and  m1 is the amplitude of the transition dipole moment. For the following, the system will interact with an electric field oriented along the ˆε= zˆ axis of the laboratory.  Remember that in describing the probability of occupying an initial state, we need to consider both probability of occupying the initial state at temperature T and the probability of having a particular orientation in the laboratory frame. The initial state of the system will always be isotropically distributed, i.e. equal probability of finding a dipole oriented in any direction. a)  Evaluate the dipole matrix element  k ˆε⋅µ A  for the interactions between an initial A  =  n J M  and a final state state orientational and vibrational variables.

1.  Matrix Algebra Margenau and Murphy, The Mathematics of Physics and Chemistry, Chapter 10, give almost all the back­ground relevant for physical applications. Schiﬀ, Quantum Mechanics, Chapter VI, and many other texts, give useful brief summaries. Here we shall note only a few of the most important deﬁnitions and theorems. The matrix is a square or rectangular array of numbers that can be added to or multiplied into another matrix according to certain rules. For a matrix A, the elements are denoted Ai j, where indices refer to rows and columns respectively. Addition. If two matrices A and B have the same rank (same number of rows and the same number of columns) they may be added element by element. If the sum matrix is called C =  A +  B then The addition is commutative: Ci j  =  Ai j  +  Bi j. A +  B =  B +  A. (
2) Multiplication. Two matrices A and B can be multiplied together to give C=  AB by the following rule Ci j  = ΣkAik Bk j. (
3) If A has m rows and n columns, B must have n rows and m columns if C is a square matrix with m rows and m columns.  Each element Ci j  of the product is a sum of products along the ith  row of A and the  jth column of B. For example, for 2 ×  2 matrices:  A11 B11  +  A12 B21  A11 B12  +  A12 B22 A21 B11  +  A22 B21  A21 B12  +  A22 B22  A11A12  B11B12 A21A22  B21B22 =    ! !  ! Note that in general matrix multiplication is not commutative: AB � BA. (
4) From the deﬁnitions it follows at once that the distributive law of multiplication still holds for matrices: A(B +  C) =  AB +  AC. (
5) Handout: Notes on Matrix Methods Revised February, 1982 Page 2 Likewise, the associative law holds: A(BC) =  (AB)C. (
6) Inverse of a matrix.  Matrix division is not deﬁned.  A matrix may or may not possess an inverse A−1, which is deﬁned by AA−1  =  E and A−1A =  E (
7) where E is the unit matrix (consisting of 1’s along the diagonal and 0’s elsewhere).  The Matrix A is said to be nonsingular if it possesses an inverse and singular if it does not.  If A is nonsingular and of ﬁnite rank, it can be shown to be square and the i j element of its inverse is just the cofactor of A ji  divided by the determinant of A. Thus A is singular if its determinant vanishes. It is readily veriﬁed from (
8) The determinant of a square matrix is found from the usual rule for the computation of the determinant of a square array of numbers, e.g.        =  A11A22A33  +  A12A23A31  +  A13A32A21  −  A13A22A31  −  A12A21A33  −  A11A32A
9) Special Matrices.  A matrix is real if all the elements are real.  It is symmetric if it is the same as its transpose; Hermitian if it is the same as its adjoint; orthogonal if it is the same as its inverse; unitary if its Handout: Notes on Matrix Methods Revised February, 1982 Page 3 adjoint is the same as its inverse. In summary: Type of Matrix  Deﬁnition Relation Real Symmetric Hermitian Orthogonal Unitary A⋆  =  A A′  =  A A′†  =  A A′  =  A−1 A†  =  A−1 Also, a matrix is diagonal if all its non-diagonal elements are zero and null if all of its elements are zero. Be forewarned that various authors use diﬀerent symbols to denote some of these special matrices. Transformations of  Matrices.  Two  square  matrices  A  and  B  are  said  to  be  related  by  a  similarity transformation if A =  T−1BT where T is a nonsingular square matrix. Clearly, the inverse transformation gives  B =  T−1(cid:

13) where λ j  is a particular eigenvalue and the index k is summed over from 1 to the rank N of the matrix M. (
1) where the solution for the unperturbed Hamiltonian H◦  is known, and H′  is a small perturbation.  Pertur­bation theory may be used to ﬁnd the small changes in the energy levels and wave functions introduced by H′ . If the matrix elements of H are evaluated in the H◦  representation, i.e., calculated with the unperturbed wave functions, the H◦  matrix is diagonal, H◦ =  Ek◦δk j.k j Several quantum numbers may be needed to label the states of H◦; here k represents the entire set.  Some of the unperturbed states may be degenerate and k must then include an index to distinguish the members of the degenerate set. The perturbation matrix H′  will have oﬀ-diagonal terms which couple the various unperturbed states as well as diagonal terms which directly shift the energy levels. In  the usual  perturbation theory,  the shift of a  particular unperturbed energy  level  Ek◦ and  its wave function ψ◦k  is evaluated by expanding the Hamiltonian in powers of a parameter λ, H =  H◦  +  λH′  +  λ2H′′  +  . . .

In the second order approximation, there is a sum over the inﬂuence of the other states. The energy  level is  displaced upward  by  the  states of  lower energy  and  downward by  those of higher energy;  the  displacements  are  proportional  to  the  square  of  the  coupling  term  as  given  by  the  matrix elements of H′  and inversely proportional to the corresponding energy diﬀerences. However, if some states are degenerate with state k,  the treatment must be modiﬁed because of the vanishing energy  denominators which  make (

A Favorite Example: Coupled Harmonic Oscillators As a simple example, we treat the ground and ﬁrst excited state of two coupled linear harmonic oscillators to second order by both the usual perturbation theory and the Van Vleck transformation. The Hamiltonian is H◦  =  H◦x +  H◦y λH′  =  λxy  +  x2  +  y2  ∂2 =  −  ∂x2  + ∂2 ∂y2 !(

To check (or, in the old-fashioned terminology used by Eclipse, debug) our program, we need to set a breakpoint in our code so the program suspends execution and allows us to see its status. Without a breakpoint, the program will run to completion without letting us look at its status. To set a breakpoint, double-click in the gray margin on the left side of the editor next to the line at which you‟d like program execution to stop. A blue dot will appear, indicating an active breakpoint.  In this example, set the breakpoint at the line with System.out.println(…) Starting the program to check is similar to running it. Eclipse provides two options: Use the full-service Run  Debug menu selection to use a launch configuration, or use the  express Run  Debug As  Java Application selection if the default options are OK.

1. ArrayLists (30 points)   You are the director of a large cruise ship. There are two classes in your program: Passenger  and CruiseShip. The Passenger class, which represents a single passenger on the ship, has  three data members: the passenger’s age, name, and a boolean variable stating whether the  passenger is a first class passenger or not. Passenger is defined as follows:      package travel; public class Passenger                                                              {        String name; int age; boolean isFirstClass;      //isFirstClass is true when the passenger is a first class              //passenger, false otherwise    public Passenger(String n, int a, boolean c){            name = n;      age = a;      isFirstClass = c;      }        }   The CruiseShip class contains an ArrayList of Passengers, a constructor, and two additional  methods.    //code continued on next page

4.  In  the  very  preliminary  planning  of  some  harbor  island  developments,  there  wasdiscussion regarding the cost estimates of building five bridges. There had as yet not beena preliminary soil survey in the harbor area, and it was recognized that the bridge costsare highly dependent  on soil  conditions.  Therefore,  there was great  uncertainty in thepreliminary cost estimates. A spokesman, however, made this statement; “I recognize the uncertainty on the cost estimate of any bridge. But I am much more confident of ourestimate for the total cost of all five bridges because the likelihood that a high estimate on one will be balanced by a low estimate on another.”Discuss this statement. Use your knowledge, simply, of the means and variancesof sums of random variables to support your comments. If your initial intuition lies with the spokesman, be sure you resolve in your own mind why it is inconsistent.  Compare both the variance and the coefficients of variation of the total cost versus those of an individual cost. If the five bridge sites are relatively close to one another, soil conditions, althoughunknown, are probably similar. What implications does this observation have for your analysis? Would your answer change in the case of 10 bridges?

6.  Mortgage Crisis—the Home Buyer: A bank has a policy that it will approve a mortgage for someone only if they have a steady income that is sufficient to cover the costs of home ownership. In addition to monthly payments of interest and principal, the bank requires the homeowner to make monthly payments into an escrow account that the bank will used to pay property taxes, property insurance, and mortgage insurance. The bank requires this arrangement so that it can be certain that the property taxes are in fact paid on time, that the property is insured in the case of fire or other disaster, and that the mortgage payments will be made even if the homeowner dies. The bank uses two common rules of thumb in reviewing mortgage applications. First, the buyer should make a down payment of at least 20% of the cost of house (and homeowners are not allowed to borrow this money from someone else—they must be able to produce the cash from their own resources). Second, the sum of the mortgage payment plus the escrow payment should be no more than 30% of the homeowner’s income.  a.  Consider a family with annual income of $60,

Assume that the bank will provide a 30-year mortgage with the maximum amount no greater than the minimum of (a) project cost or (b) 80% of the net present value of the rents (calculated with a discount rate equal to the interest rate on the loan). What would the maximum amount of the mortgage be? What would the monthly payments be?

What is the minimum sale price they should accept assuming that their discount rate remains 15%? (Assume that the new owners will take over the mortgage, and be sure to include the balance on the mortgage in the sale price!) b.  Suppose they see great opportunities in South American gold mines, where they expect to make a 25% return—how low would they go? c.  What would you recommend as a reasonable sale price for the building? Why?  Note : Only 3-member teams are expected to complete question

As  you  know,  the rocket assembly burns a huge amount of fuel during takeoﬀ, and the rate of this burn is not aﬀected by the steering.  Because of the burn, however, the mass of the rocket is continually  decreasing  and its distribution  is continually  changing.  Consider  that  the input is a perturbation to the ﬁn angle, and the output is the pitch angle of the rocket. (As described, this system is linear.) The  system  is  time-varying.  The  problem  is  an  inverted  pendulum,  but  the  mass 1  LINEAR TIME INVARIANCE 2 at  the  top  is  changing;  hence,  a  given  deﬂection  of  the  control  surfaces  will  give  a diﬀerent  dynamic  response  at  diﬀerent  times  during  the  ﬂight.

Historically, the problem was one of the early successes  in optimal control theory. 
3.  Determine whether the following is likely to be a linear system or not; why?  A power electronics  network  contains  resistors  that  heat  up  when  the current  through them is large.

The system is nonlinear, because running at diﬀerent power levels will lead to diﬀerent operating  temperatures  and  diﬀerent  resistances.

You could  execute  fft(hreg)  of  course,  which builds oﬀ your original simulation.  But the crucial observation here is that we already know the transform of the impulse response - it is the same as the transfer function! H  = √ 1 −ω2 +

2. What is the longest distance mission that we can run? Give the distance, duration,and vehicle speed for this mission.The battery energy loss rate is a static function of load, so we have to just pick the bestspeed and run until the battery is dead. My code takes a numerical approach, sweepingthrough a number of possible speeds and picking out the case with greatest distance.You could also do it directly, by writing one equation for the distance as a function ofthe speed, and then ﬁnding the maximum using l’Hopital’s rule (zero slope). Eitherway, we ﬁnd that the greatest distance is about

1. For  a  planar  setting,  how  many  satellites  are  required  to  uniquely  locate  a  target  at an  arbitrary  location,  and  how  these  should  be  laid  out?  Include  sketches  as  needed to explain your reasoning. Three  satellites  give  three  ranges,  corresponding  with  three  circles.  The  intersection of circles is - in the best case - a single point, the unique localization result.  There are several notable conditions where you’ll get bad results with three satellites.  If they are colinear,  you  get  no  information  about  location  in  the  direction  perpendicular  to  the line.  When  noise  is  included  (as  below),  we  don’t  want  to  be  even  close  to  colinear: we  want  low aspect-ratio  (”not  too long  and  thin”)  triangles.  More  fundamentally,  if the  target  is  located  on  or  near  the  line  connecting  any  two  satellites,  then  it  is  as  if we have lost one satellite - the second range measurement  does us very little good. 
2.  Consider a problem now in three-space.  Two satellites are given, with locations [X,Y,Z] of [500, 500, 1000]m and [−500, 500, 1000]m.  The target ranges are measured at 724m and

The listed Runge-Kutta algorithm is third-order accurate in the step and second-order accurate in the whole:  in each step, we get a cancelation of all the second-order terms in the Taylor series!

1.  Derive and state the equation of motion for this system. Solution:  It is a basic rotary moment of inertia with a gravity eﬀect and input torque. We will get ml2θ ¨ = τ − mgl cos θ. 
2.  For each of the linearization angles [-90,0,90] degrees, answer the following: (a)  What is the static torque needed to support the arm in this conﬁguration? Solution:  For  the  three  angles  given,  the  static  torque  is  the  amount  needed  to just balance the gravity torque.  These values are [0, mgl, 0]; note that the upward and downward conﬁgurations do not take any static torque to maintain. (b)  Assuming that the static torque is continuously applied, but that there is no dy­namic torque, what is the equation of motion for small deviations from the static angle?  We are looking for a diﬀerential equation in the perturbation of θ, say θ˜. Solution:  The key here is to write the angles and the torques as being comprised of a static (θ,¯ tau) and a dynamic part (θ,˜ τ˜): ¯ml2  ddt � � θ¯ + θ˜ = ¯τ + ˜τ − mgl cos(θ¯ + θ˜) + d θ˜ = ¯τ − mgl cos θ¯cos θ˜− mgl sin θ¯sin θ˜ + d. ml2  ddt Along  with  a  trigonometric  identity,  we  used  the  facts  that  dynamic  torque  τ˜ iszero,  and  that  static  angle  θ¯ has  zero  second  derivative.  We  can  see  that  cos θ˜14  PENDULUM DYNAMICS AND LINEARIZATION 36 linearizes  to simply  one, and so the ﬁrst  two terms on the right-hand side in the second line give us precisely the static torques of part (i).  The term d represents a torque perturbation.  We are left with the following linear equations for the three static angles [-90, 0, 90] degrees, respectively: ¨ mgl θ˜ =  −mglθ˜ + d ¨ mgl θ˜ =  d ¨ mgl θ˜ =  mglθ˜ + d. (c)  In words and in an annotated graph, show what is the response of the equilibrium system  to  a  (small)  torque  impulse.  Be  sure  to  take  into  account  the  fact  that the system could respond diﬀerently to impulses of opposite directions. Solution:  The ﬁrst diﬀerential equation above is that of a second-order, undamped oscillator.  A perturbation to the equilibrium  will lead to oscillations of constant size.  The  second  equation  above  is  a  ”double  integrator,”  like  a  mass  on  a  slid­ing  contact;  an impulsive  d will  set  the arm spinning  at constant  speed,  with no damping or restoring force.  Of course, as the arm travels our linearizing assump­tions  (namely  that  θ˜ is  small)  fail,  and  we  see  some  other  interesting  behavior. If  the  perturbation  is  upward,  the  static  torque  will  be  larger  than  the  gravity torque, and the arm will accelerate in the positive direction, up and over the top! If the perturbation is negative, we can again expect an acceleration in the positive direction  for  the  same  reasons,  again  going  up  and  over.  It  doesn’t  get  stuck  at zero  degrees  because  there  is  no  damping  and  inertia  will  carry  it  through.  Fi­nally, the upward static conﬁguration is just plain unstable because it is as if we have a negative spring term - any perturbation will cause the arm to fall over.

1.  Formulate  the  system  dynamics  with  an  annotated  drawing  and  a  statement  of  the governing equations. Solution:  Let  us  say  that  vertical  position  y  = 0  corresponds  with  the  spring  in  its natural,  uncompressed  state,  and  it  is  just  touching  the  ground.  Then  when  y <  0, there is a compression force pushing the mass upward at ky, and the associated damping by˙. When  y > 0,  there is no  spring  force at all.  In all  cases,  there  is a steady  gravity force acting.  We have then: my¨ + by˙ + ky  =  −mg  when y < 0 , or my¨ =  −mg  when y > 
2.  Is this a linear system - why or why not?  Since we are not forcing the system, you can answer  the  question  by  considering  how  the  response  changes  as  you  scale  the  initial conditions. Solution:  The system is nonlinear.  If we apply a very large preload before release, we will  get  a  large  hopping  response,  whereas  if  we  apply  a  very  small  preload  the  mass may not hop at all, because the spring doesn’t fully unload. 
3.  Run a simulation to get the response up to time ten seconds.	 Show in a plot both the vertical position and the velocity as a function of time. Solution:  See  that  attached  code  and  ﬁgure.  Note  that  when  the  spring  is  unloaded, the  velocity  is  changing  linearly  with  time  (constant  acceleration),  whereas  when  the spring is loaded, a sinusoidal  velocity proﬁle occurs.

1. Don’t turn anything in on this part. The FFT (Fast Fourier Transform) is a standardmethod for decomposition of a signal into its harmonic components. You need to knowa few speciﬁc items about it:(a) The length of the input signal x - in the time domain - is N . The FFT itselfdoesn’t care about what is the time step between xn and xn+1, although thespacing must be uniform; below, we’ll call it ∆t. Hence x1 occurs at time 0, x2 isat time ∆t, and so on, up to xN taken at time (N − 
2. Now we use the FFT as a tool for analyzing system response to both speciﬁc and, later,to stochastic forcing signals.First, ﬁnd the impulse response of the system x(cid:

4. Now, make up a new input u, that we will use in the rest of this problem: u = 1 ift < T /2, u = 0 if t ≥ T /
5. Now we are ready to make the computation of the system response to the input u inthree diﬀerent ways! The ﬁrst is the simplest - just run the simulation with the inputu. Make a plot of x vs. t.
6. The second method is to convolve the input u with the impulse response h. We haveto use a consistent time base, and that is why we made ureg and hreg. MATLAB hasa command called conv which you can use; the convolution integral is the same as thisvector convolution if you multiply the latter by dt; i.e., we have to calculate the areaunder the curve.Plot the ﬁrst N elements of the convolution result versus treg. It should look almostthe same as what you found from the direct simulation.
7. The third method is to multiply the FFT of the impulse response with the FFT of theinput u. In this case, you will do a vector pointwise multiplication (.* is the syntax)17  DYNAMICS CALCULATIONS USING THE TIME AND FREQUENCY DOMAINS53 of U  =  fft(ureg)  and the  FFT of  h.  You could  execute  fft(hreg)  of  course,  which builds oﬀ your original simulation.  But the crucial observation here is that we already know the transform of the impulse response - it is the same as the transfer function! H  = √ 1 −ω2 +

Second,  the  average  lowest  value among  the  1/N’th  highest  is  intuitively  very  close  to  the  highest  wave  seen  in  N  ob­servations.  Note  that  this  average  lowest  value  among  the  1/N’th  highest  waves,  the 1/N’th maximum, is in contrast with the average 1/N’th highest value, which is quite a bit larger since it includes waves of arbitrarily large amplitude. MIT OpenCourseWarehttp://ocw.mit.edu 
1.  What  is  the  variance  of	 h,  from  the  simple  time  formula?  What  is  the  signiﬁcant (average 1/3-highest) height based on this variance? The variance  is the time average  of h(t)2,  because  the signal  has zero  mean;  it  comes out to 
2.  Write a program to count the waves using zero upcrossings as the endpoints for cycles. How  many  full  waves  do  you  get?  What  is  the  signiﬁcant  height  from  these  observa­tions?  What  is  the  average  period?  Make  histograms  (20  bins  please)  of  the  heights and of the periods observed. There are 415 complete waves,  the one-third average highest  height is

2.  What  is  the  characteristic  frequency  of  the  windspeed  ﬂuctuations?	 What  is  the  ap­proximate standard deviation of wind velocity, and the signiﬁcant amplitude ¯a1/3? Solution:  The  peak  frequency  is  apparently  at  about  ﬁfty  cycles  per  hour,  or  one cycle  per  72  seconds.  To  get  σ  and  a¯1/3  = 2σ,  we  have  to  get  the  area  under  the spectrum.  The  attached  code  shows  how  to  do  this  - see  also  the  worked  example on the Bretschneider  spectrum.  The standard deviation here is

What is the transfer function E(jω)/W (jω)?  Note that the aircraft has negligible mass.  Hint:  it is a low-pass ﬁlter. Solution:  The  linearization  is  e˙ = −Uφ + w  or  e˙ = −60 × 
2.  Make  a  plot  of  one  thousand  seconds  of	 w(t)  just  as  in  Homework  4,  and  show  the corresponding system output e(t), in meters.  For this, you need to solve the diﬀerential equation numerically. See attached code and the ﬁrst two plots. 
3.  Using the Wiener-Khinchine relation, make a plot of Se(ω).  Then calculate the signif­icant  error  ¯e1/3,  and plot  the plus  and minus  values  of this on your  time domain plot above. The W-K relation says that Se(ω) = |F (jω)|2Sw(ω), so all you need is a pointwise multiplication in frequency space of the input spectrum Sw(ω) by the squared  magnitude of the transfer function, |F (jω)|

7.  What  are  the  signiﬁcant  heights  (double  amplitudes)  of  the  heave  and  the  pitch  mo­tions?  Based on plots of the output spectra, about what are the dominant frequencies of these two motions? Solution:  The  signiﬁcant  heave  height  is  
1) one where Fu, Fv, and M  are all commanded independently,  e.g.,  using  independent  thrusters,  and  
2)  one  where  Fv  =  pvδFu  and  M  = pφδFu.  This  second  case  is  encountered  if  there  is  a  surge  thruster  (or  set),  whose  exhaust pushes  on  a  rudder  with  (body-referenced)  angle  δ.  To  create  a  lateral  force  or  moment, you  have  to  have  some  Fu  and  some  rudder  action.  We  will  use  the  values  pv  = 
3.  Case 2:  Develop a mission controller that maneuvers the vehicle from an all-zero start­ing  condition  to  the  state  [u, v, r, X, Y, φ] =  [1m/s, 0m/s, 0rad/s, 20m, 20m, π/2rad]. In  other  words,  the  vehicle  moves  while  rotating  a  quarter-turn,  and  passes  through the desired X, Y  location at speed and with no yaw rate. 29  FLIGHT CONTROL OF A HOVERCRAFT 100 You can’t use the same strategy as for Case 1, because the craft can only actuate sway and yaw  together.  We say that this system  is under-actuated.  It is not acceptable to create  by  hand  a  sequence  of  control  actions  that  achieves  the  move,  or  to  create  an algorithm  that  uses  speciﬁc  times;  they  will  never  work  in  practice  due  to  modeling errors and external disturbances.  What I do recommend is that you use an intermediate waypoint on the way to the goal.  This is a target X, Y  that you go to ﬁrst, so that the vehicle will then line up well with the goal.  Airplanes are doing this sort of maneuver when  they  circle  an  airport  in  preparation  for  landing.  Your  mission  procedure  is to  head  for  the  intermediate  waypoint  until  the  craft  arrives  within  a  small  radius of  it  (several  meters,  say),  and  then  head  to  the  goal.  One  well-chosen  intermediate waypoint should be enough for this problem, but you could use more if you like. The low-level control strategy is also diﬀerent from Case

1.  Is the sensor noise process either stationary or ergodic?  Explain. Summary:  The  sensor  noise  is  not  stationary,  because  its  statistics  (variance  in  par­ticular)  are  not  constant  through  time.  The  sensor  noise  is  worst  at  high  altitudes and best at low altitudes.  Ergodicity implies that the time statistics and the ensemble statistics  are  the  same  - in  this  case,  clearly  the  ensemble  variance  at  any  given  time cannot equal  the variance over  time of any  particular  realization.  Hence  the  noise process is not ergodic either.

4.  We  need  to  achieve  through  feedback  a)  integral  action,  b)  a  phase  margin  of  30-40 degrees, and c) a gain margin of at least two.  To do this, design a controller C(s) with the following properties: it to be deﬁnitely not in the RHP); •	 a real pole just to the left of the origin, corresponding with an integrator (we want •	 a  stable  complex  zero  pair  that  approximately  mirrors  the  unstable  plant  poles •	 two  additional  stable,  real  poles  so  that  the  compensator  has  a  high-frequency across the imaginary axis, but possibly with a higher damping ratio; roll-oﬀ behavior. State the complete transfer function of your designed compensator, show that it achieves the desired gain and phase margins on a plot of P (s)C(s) loci, and show a closed-loop step response to prove that it is indeed well-behaved.

1.  For  the  nominal  system  model  (as  above)  design  a  proportional-derivative  controllerso  that  the  closed-loop  step  response  reaches  the  commanded  angle  for  the  ﬁrst  timein  about  one  second  and  the  maximum  overshoot  is  twenty  percent.  The  closed-loopsystem equation isJφ ¨ =  kt(− kp(φ − φdesired) − kdφ˙) −→ Jφ ¨ + ktkdφ˙ + ktkpφ  =  ktkpφdesired. Remember that if you write the left-hand side of the equation as φ¨+2ζωn +ωn2 , you can tune  this  up  quite  easily  because  the  overshoot  scales  directly  with  damping  ratio  ζ, and you can then adjust ωn  to get the right rise time.  Show a plot of the step response and list your two gains kp  and kd. The  step  response  for  the  nominal  system  is  shown,  along  with  the  ”four  corners”  of the parameter space, that is, at the max and min combinations of J and kt.

1.  What is the distance KM  for this section, at small roll angles?  You may approximate the area of the ”buoyancy wedges” as the mean height times the width. The diﬀerential moment is  as follows: dM  = 2 × b2θ ×52b × ρg dx, 5 2 where  the  terms  separated  by  the ×  symbol  are  for:  two  wedges,  the  area  enclosed  in each  wedge  (approximation),  the  moment  arm  of  each  wedge,  density  and  gravity  and the  diﬀerential length.  We  know that ρgd∇(KM)θ = dM,  which leads directly to KM  = 25 b2 . 4  T There is an additional term T /2 (as in the case of monohulls) but this is very small by comparison for  a  catamaran.

See the ﬁgure:  The righting moment essentially goes ﬂat once a hull is out of the water, because  the  there  is  no  more  loss  of  buoyancy  on  one  side  and  gain  of  buoyancy  on the other,  as roll increases.  You have left only the center  of mass against buoyancy at the submerged hull.  As the angle increases further, the righting moment arm decreases with  the cosine of  the  roll angle. A  proa  is  an  unusual  sailing  boat  with  one  large  hull,  and  a  very  light  pontoon  on  a long arm.

Make  a  plot  to  verify  that  you  have  a  ratio  of  at  least  three  or  so,  up  to  the highest frequency you will use in the following calculations. The ﬁgure below shows that we are OK up to about two radians per second, considering each  hull  alone.  If  we  take  the  whole  vessel  beam,  then  we  could  only  do  the  higher sea states, e.g., ω <

4.  Under the same conditions, calculate and show in a graph the pitch moment magnitude as a function of wave frequency.  Take the moment around the lower end of the body.

5.  If the water depth is just twenty meters, for what range of frequencies is the analysis of the vertical body loading reasonable?  In deep water, we approximate the wave velocity as  g/k, whereas in the general case it is  g tanh(kh)/k, where h is the water depth. � tanh(kh) is close to one for all frequencies above one radian per Figure 2 shows that second.

2. Use the FFT to make the transformed signal X. Plot the magnitude of X versusfrequency; recall that the frequency vector corresponding to X goes from zero to theroughly the sampling rate (use the instructions from your previous homework).Inyour plot, only show the frequency range near 10000 rad/s where there is signiﬁcantenergy, and remember the 2/n scaling that is needed to put FFT peaks into the sameunits as x. What do you see?See the top plot of the psd’s. There are about ﬁfteen peaks at frequencies slightlyabove 10 krad/s.
3. Treatment 1: Windowing. The Fourier transform operation on a ﬁnite-length signal xassumes periodicity, and so any discontinuity between the last and the ﬁrst points inx is a feature that will be accounted for in X. In general we don’t want this eﬀect,because it muddies up the water and makes it harder to see the details in X that weare interested in. For this and some other reasons, it is common to multiply x bya windowing function, before taking the transform. There are many such windows,developed according to diﬀerent metrics. If you do no windowing, this is called theboxcar window! An easy one we can consider here is the half-sine window, w =π sin (π[0 : n − 1]/(n − 
4. Treatment 2: Zero-padding. The frequency scale to go with X is deﬁned by thesampling rate and the number of samples. To get really ﬁne resolution in frequency,we would want to sample much faster or sample a lot longer. We can’t ﬁx either ofthese once the data is obtained of course, but we can lengthen the signal artiﬁcially,either by stacking it end to end against itself, or more commonly by adding a lot ofzeros to the end of x. Do this for the windowed signal xw, with a block of 7n zerosadded on the end. Again plot the magnitude of the resulting transform. Note that youwill have to make up a new frequency vector for this case since you now have eight43  SPECTRAL ANALYSIS TO FIND A HIDDEN MESSAGE	 181 times as many points, and ditto for your amplitude scaling of the transform.  What do you see? See the bottom plot of the ﬀt’s.  The peaks now appear much more clearly because of the  improved  frequency  resolution,  and  in  fact  they  take  amplitudes  of  about  [1,2,3], and at very evenly spaced frequencies.

3. Closed system, nutrient cycle: benthic layer nitrogen The nutrient modeling example given in the Lecture08_5 outline turns out to far underestimate the measured levels of nitrogen on the bottom of the ecosystem (benthic layer).   It is found that nitrogen fixing bacteria are present on particles in suspension.  They uptake the dissolved nitrogen in a first order process (rate of uptake directly proportional to dissolved nitrogen mass), and then they settle to the bottom.  In addition, a small fraction of the dead phytoplankton and zooplankton (denoted by f), instead of becoming dissolved nitrogen, directly enters the sediment. The original model is shown below. Subscripts 1=dissolved N mass, 2 = N mass in phytoplankton, 3 = N mass in zooplankton. If we introduce a fourth compartment 4 =  N mass in sediment, write down the rate equation for the sediment nitrogen mass. Also, update the above three equations of this closed system model.

2.  Your statement of interests relative to this class. Here we suggest in a paragraph or two, certainly no more than half a page, to discuss what you hope to learn from this class and how it relates to your longer-term professional interests. We recognize you have only seen the syllabus and heard one lecture, but nonetheless it would be of value to the teaching staff to understand what you would expect your learnings to be. 
3.  This is a class about “complex systems”. We ask you to identify and briefly discuss a “complex system” with which you have had personal experience, and for which you have had some responsibility for improving. Please describe this system, how you decided what steps were appropriate to improve it, and the process by which you actually implemented those improvements – to scale this for you, we’re thinking about perhaps a page and certainly no more than two pages.  This exercise—read by the teaching staff but ungraded—will give us some sense of the interests and experiences of the students. It will allow us to begin to tailor the exercises to come, especially the term of the semester-long class-wide project—and begin to get you involved in systems thinking.

1) 12 POINTS DISTRIBUTED THURSDAY, FEBRUARY 22, 2007 DUE MONDAY, MARCH 5, 2007 Initial Representation of the SNF System Grouping For this assignment we will form groups of at least 4 students.  The groups are relatively arbitrary although we have made an attempt at intellectual diversity. See the appendix for the team assignments. Assignment Background The CEO of your consulting firm is considering participating in a bid for a project that is related to Spent Nuclear Fuel management policy. The problem details have not been clarified yet a so she wants her team (you!!) to be prepared with a system-wide understanding of the issues involved. The firm is known for its innovative recommendations that are associated with out-of-the-box thinking combined with a well-founded understanding of the issues at hand. In an effort to enhance their performance and systematize their work the CEO has decided to “test-drive” the CLIOS Process for this project. She has read the CLIOS Process user’s guide that you will have but has no other prior experience with it.  Assignment Statement Given the unknown nature of the actual contract your team should have an initial meeting or two to get organized. Each team will have a VP in the consulting firm (aka a member of the class instructing staff) as a mentor. You should plan on meeting with your mentor no later than Wednesday, Feb 
2) consider the broader issue of how nuclear energy relates to the overall provision of electric power in the US. So if you choose a subteam organizational structure, here’s how you would likely proceed. Each subteam should complete a first iteration of Steps 1-4 of the CLIOS Process as described in the user’s guide. The expected deliverables and relative workload are summarized below: Step 1 should be less than 1 page of text. The emphasis is on the checklists which should have approximately 5 to 20 items each. Step 2 defines subsystems and actor groups. You should indicate which subsystems and actor groups you choose in about a page. Steps 3&4 populate the subsystems with the most important / relevant components. One diagram per subsystem along with one page of explanation of what are the major interactions is sufficient. Try not to include more than 15 components/actors in any of your subsystems. Also populate the institutional sphere with actors and discuss the relationships among them (1 page). Finally discuss the Type 2 links (projections) between actors and components. Notice that as long as diagram notation is consistent and explained then it is not necessary for the teams to follow the CLIOS Process notation. Clarity is important though. There are several software tools you can use to create the diagrams (MS Word, MS Powerpoint, VISIO, Vensim etc). Any of the above is fine or you can do it by hand. After having completed the above you are asked to convene as a team to “merge” the two CLIOS representations and 
1) that nuclear power is a potentially valuable source of power from non-carbon based 
2) so nuclear power can be a way to address GCC 
3) that the role nuclear power can play is linked closely to how the SNF is managed (and we know that “managed” has many interpretations) and this may limit how effective the nuclear option can be  Therefore, DoE wants to consider other strategic alternatives for addressing GCC beyond sources  nuclear.   What DoE wants is a two-stage study as follows. Cite as: Joseph Sussman, course materials for ESD.04J Frameworks and Models in Engineering Systems, Spring

2.  Risk assessment/Benefit-Cost analysis for both rail and truck transportation of SNF to temporary sites, which will be located and sized by your firm  We have provided a guide to help you with this section, which is attached in Appendix II.  Of course, the DoE is also very interested in your own other strategic alternatives for both SNF and GCC, and certainly wants analyses of those included in your final report as well.  It is certainly possible that evaluating those strategic alternatives will also require some kind of benefit-cost analysis and/or risk-assessment as well, but perhaps some other methods might be more useful.   DoE will be interested in how your bundle performs across the various scenarios outlined in P

1. There are 6 sites where SNF is currently stored numbered from 1 to 6 and marked as grey triangles on the map. There are two proposals for storing the fuel: (i) using a single centralized long-term facility (Marked X), or (ii) using two shorter-term smaller centralized facilities marked A and B. Finding acceptable sites for this use was hard and their position currently satisfies both political and scientific constraints for the anticipated length of storage. As a result identifying other potential areas or routes is not an alternative at this point. The transportation of SNF is expected to be completed within 10 years. SNF can be transported either by rail OR by truck – i.e. no hybrid transportation solutions can be implemented.  Table 1 displays information about the network routes that have already been found to provide the minimum exposure of general population while SNF is en route.

4.  Using the event trees, calculate the end probabilities for having zero incidents, mild incidents, or severe incidents. What are the expected values of their costs? 
5.  All else being equal which combination of storage site and transportation mode would you recommend? Does your answer change if you take transportation cost into account? 
6.  A research fund has been designated to improve reliability of the SNF transport. You are asked to choose how much money to allocate in increasing the reliability by one order of magnitude of the container or of the GPS unit. Assuming that any changes do not impact production costs, which of the two would be your top priority? How much money would you be willing to invest in it?   The use of a spreadsheet like Excel is highly recommended. You could also use decision analysis software e.g. the evaluation version of TreeAge or the Palisade PrecisionTree to draft the event trees but this is not necessary for completing the assignment and may actually delay your work.

5. Euler - Buckling & the World Trade Center Towers:	  Following the destruction of the World Trade Center Towers on September 11, 2001, it has been reported that buckling of the columns had onset the fall of the towers. The focus of this exercise is to check this conjecture by means of a dimensional analysis. The first part of this exercise aims at deriving the governing equation of buckling; the second part then uses this result to make an informed analysis of the buckling of the columns of the WTC towers. a)	 The buckling of columns is one critical stability problem in the design of beam-type structures. In contrast to the strength limit, the elastic stability problem of a column relates to the presence of imperfections. The elastic column buckling can be described as follows: consider a column of length l , and (for purpose of analysis) circular section of radius  R < l . The column is made of an elastic material whose stiffness is defined by the Young's modulus  E ‡. The column is subjected at its top to a force  P . If the force were applied exactly in the column axis, the column would not buckle. However, imperfections are unavoidable. To consider those imperfections consider that the force was applied with an eccentricity of e <<  (see figure). Ri.	ii.	Buckling occurs when the applied force  P  reaches the buckling load  Pcrit . Formulate the problem, i.e., find the relevant parameters of the problem. The eccentric applied force causes a moment  M  = Pe , which leads to the deformation in these lectures, the moment is related to this deformation by a linear moment curvature constitutive law: ( ) of the column as sketched in the figure. As we will see later on w zM  ∝ ER 4  d 2 wdz 2 ‡ The concept of stiffness relates to the ability of the material to deform under application of loads. In

5. A truss system in a bridge deck: In recitation, we learned about the Akashi-Kaikyo suspension bridge in Japan. As shown in the photograph below, the bridge’s deck rests on a truss system. While the actual truss system is a complex 3-D structure, we will analyze a 2-D section as displayed below. The 2-D truss system is subjected to a distributed load of D = 800 kN/m, which represents the weight of the deck. The goal of this exercise is to calculate the force in all truss members. Think carefully about how to handle the distributed load in order to analyze the truss structure.  Discuss what kind of implications your assumptions may have, and what kinds of phenomena may not be captured correctly. Photograph removed due to copyright restrictions.

2.  A nano truss:  Advances in nanoscience and nanotechnology* now enable us to build structures at molecular scales, with atomistic precision.  An important building block of many nanostructures are carbon nanotubes (CNTs), a particularly sturdy form of carbon arranged in a tubular structure.  A picture of a CNT is shown below.    From a mechanical perspective, CNTs are particularly intriguing as they are one of the strongest and stiffest materials known; yet, they are extremely lightweight.  Applications of CNTs range from reinforcement for concrete (to supplement or replace steel reinforcement), polymers to important applications in energy related technologies, such as hydrogen storage for fuel cell applications. Nanoscopic truss structures of CNTs may find applications in ultra-small devices to clean water, to harvest sunlight or to analyze genetic information.    This exercise introduces you to the possibility to utilize structural engineering tools typically applied to ‘macroscopic’ objects like bridges, buildings etc. to nanostructured objects.    Figure by MIT OpenCourseWare.Snapshots of a CNT.  It can be envisioned as a rolled up sheet of graphene (graphene denotes a single layer in graphite).  Many different types of CNTs (different sizes, multiple nested CNTs like in a Russian Doll…) can be synthesized.  Here we consider a truss structure build out of CNT elements.  We will consider a particular geometry of a CNT as shown on the next page.  Below you will find some relevant information about the material and the geometry of CNTs:  •  Young’s modulus (a measure of stiffness),  E = 2  TPa •  Bond strength of a single covalent C-C bond,  Pbond = 3 nN •  Outside radius of CNT,  R0 = 8  Å •  Area moment of inertia (assuming circular cross-section),  πR 44•  Critical buckling load for a simply supported column (which we had applied earlier to I = Pcrit =our truss members), the length of the member.

5. Variation of Quiz 1 To provide additional practice, please redo a slightly modified version of Quiz I.  A cylindrical pothole in a pavement is filled with a new material subjected to vehicle traffic.  The aim of this exercise is to analyze stresses and strength compatibility of this repair solution. Engineering Model: To this end, we model the pothole as a cylinder of diameter and height L (see figure below). The surrounding pavement (old material) is so old that it can be considered as rigid compared to the new material filling the cubic pothole. The load to which the pot hole is subjected is the tire pressure p. We neglect body forces (i.e. deadweight), and all surfaces between the new material in the pothole and the rigid material surrounding it, are frictionless. The entire problem will be solved in a cylindrical coordinate system.   Due: Wednesday – October 31, 2007 (In class)    Page 8 of 9

1. Gγy γ r=ri r= R τ= τy τ =Gγ Mt, φConsider the shear stress distribution at some instance beyond the onset of yield. Onset of yield will occur when the shear stress at the outer radius of the shaft, r = R, attains the value τy. With some additional  loading,  some  additional  torque  applied,  the  shear stress distribution over the radius might appear as at the left. We  show  the  material  yielding  in  the  region  of  the  cylinder beyond  some  radius  r = ri  where  the  subscript  “i”  denotes  the radius at the interface of the elastic and perfectly plastic regions. In that region of plastic ﬂow, the shear stress is everywhere equal to the shear stress at yield, τy. At  r = ri, the shear stress and strain are just τy and γy  respectively. The material within the core of the shaft, r < ri continues to deform elastically. Within  this  elastic  region,  we  have  a  linear  distribution  of  both stress and strain with r, which can be written: τ  =  τ ⋅    y     r----ri and γ  =  γ ⋅    r----y   ri This stress distribution results in a torque, which we obtain from an integration over the area of the entire cross-section.

A point mass of mass  m  is hanging from a thin, massless and inextensible string that winds several turns around a pulley of mass m and radius r as shown in Figure 3(a).

3.  Ski-board on an incline (35 points) 3 In  this  problem  we  will  study  dynamics  of  a  ski-board  sliding  down  an  incline  via  a  simple model. The ski-board is modeled as a slender rod of mass m and length 2l with two end-points P and Q as shown in the figure below. Let C be the center of the rod. The moment of inertia of the rod about the axis coming out of the page through C is 1 ml 2 . The incline makes 45o angle with the horizontal. Each of the end-points P and Q is connected to a separate mass-less platform that rolls  along  the  inclined  surface  by  a  spring  of  spring-constant  k.  The  center  of  the  rod  is connected to yet another mass-less platform that rolls along the inclined surface by a dashpot of damping-constant c. The mass-less trucks always maintain contact with the incline and ensure that  the  springs  and  the  dashpot  always  remain  perpendicular  to  the  inclined  surface.  In  this simple setting, we sum up the effect of a person standing on the ski-board as an external force F that always acts vertically downwards at point Q as shown in the figure. Assume that both the springs are initially un-stretched. Determine the equation(s) of motion of the ski-board using the Lagrangian  approach  following  the  six  steps  we  studied  in  the  class:  define  frames  and generalized  coordinate(s),  find  kinetic  energy,  find  potential  energy,  define  Lagrangian  of  the system, take derivatives and find the generalized force(s).

001) when the unit in which you measure becomes larger (N to kN).   PROBLEM 3:  - Many of you seemed confused about the meaning of the accuracy of an estimate. When you have a series of measurements of an unknown parameter (µ in this problem), your best estimate of the true value is the mean, and the accuracy is given in terms of the standard deviation. Assuming the error to be normally distributed (which is generally the case), the most precise way of giving the value of the unknown parameter is as  (value of the parameter) = (mean) ± 2*(standard deviation)  where 2*(standard deviation) is the accuracy of the estimate. Due to the properties of the normal distribution, you can be 95% sure that the true value of the parameter will be within ± 2 standard deviations about the mean.    GENERAL COMMENTS:  - In general, we think that you give too little information about how you resolve the problems. It is not enough to write some equations; you need to show the details of your work and explain in words what you are doing. Along the same lines, please avoid giving a numerical answer without an explanation of where it comes from. If you don’t show your calculations and your numerical answer is wrong, you’ll most likely get 0 points in that part. Even if your numerical answer is right, you probably won’t get full score, since you are not proving that you know how to do the problem.

1) when we assumed inviscid flow and didn’t have losses. Now, we are dealing with real flows, in which there are usually losses. Furthermore, these real flows are not usually uniform in the cross-section, and we are not usually interested in determining velocities at specific points of the cross-section. Rather, we are interested in determining the “cross-sectional averaged” properties of the flow, and thus we work with the cross-sectional average velocity, V. For this reason, we have developed the control volume analysis, which deals with cross-sectional averaged quantities. The conservation of energy between the inflow and the outflow of a Control Volume reads  z1,CG + p1,CG/(ρg) + V1 It  looks  similar  to  our  old  good  Bernoulli,  but  it is  conceptually  different!  Now  we  apply  conservation  of energy between two sections (not two points), which are the inflow and the outflow of our Control Volume. z1,CG is the elevation of the center of gravity of section 1, p1,CG the pressure at the center of gravity of section 1,  and  V1  the  average  velocity  in  section  1  (not  the  velocity  at  a  particular  point).  So,  in  the  future,  be explicit about which version of Bernoulli you are applying, and between which and which section (or which and which point). NOTE: To apply conservation principles, the control volume must always be chosen so that the flow is well-behaved  both  in  the  inflow  and  the  outflow.  For  this  reason,  pressure  is  hydrostatic  at  these  sections. Therefore, the piezometric head, z1,CG + p1,CG/(ρg),  is constant in all the points on the inflow section (and same for the outflow), and you can evaluate the sum of these two terms at any point, not necessarily at the center of gravity.  PROBLEM 3: 2/(2g) = z2,CG + p2,CG/(ρg) + V22/(2g) + (losses between 1 and 
2)  - Notice that the reason why we can neglect the headloss in problems 1 and 3 is because in both cases we have  a  short  transition  of  a  converging  flow.  Since  the  transition  is  short,  the  friction  loss  is  very  small. Since the flow is always converging, there is no minor loss. Problem #4: A few groups didn't have the formula for head loss quite right – we must also take into account the elevation difference  from  one  side  of  the  hydraulic  jump  to  the  other.  The  formula  can  easily  be  derived  from  the equation: H_1 =  H_2 +  HL_(1-->

2.  The  pipe from A to B  has length L = 5000 m, diameter D = 80 cm, and roughness � = 2 mm.  The maximum  pressure  allowed  in  the  pipe  is  100  mwc  (meters  of  water  column).  Account  for minor losses only at the reentrant inﬂow and at the outﬂow. a) Design a system of serial pumps to lift the water from A to B, specifying number of pumps, pump head, and position of the pumps in the pipe (model the pipe as having constant slope from  A  to  B).  If  you  need  more  than  one  pump,  these  should  be  identical,  i.e.,  all  pumps must have the same pump head.  The required NPSH is 6 mwc.  The design criteria, in order of decreasing priority, are:  (i) Satisfy all the pressure constraints; (ii) Minimize the number of pumps; (iii) Minimize the pump head. b) Draw the energy grade line, EGL, specifying the relevant values. c) Determine the cost of operating the system if the pump eﬃciency is 
001. I point this out because approximating S0 by tan α would not be correct if α was large, in which case you would have to calculate S0 = sin α .  - A nice ornament to the solution of this problem (worth one bonus point) is to check that flow is indeed rough turbulent, so that to apply Manning is correct (see my solution). Usually, flow in natural channels is rough turbulent, so you are generally safe by using Manning. But it doesn’t hurt to check at the end, if you suspect that the assumption of R.T. flow may be invalid or if you have some time to spare.  PROBLEM 3:  - As opposed to problem 2, here you need to subdivide the section, because the bottom is not uniform. You should divide  it  into three subsections, according to the three different bottom roughnesses,  but no more. Don’t subdivide the central subsection, because this is inaccurate if you don’t account for fluid-fluid friction on the interfaces.  - To compute the flowrate contribution of the central subsection, you cannot just use the result from problem 2, because now the depth in the central subsection is larger (4 meters as opposed to 2 meters before). You cannot add a contribution from the additional upper rectangle to the solution of problem 2, either. Instead, you need to calculate a flowrate for the whole central subsection from scratch (as most of you did), because this is the only way of getting the right value of the hydraulic radius.  PROBLEM 4: Everyone did well on this problem. Most groups had a point or two taken off for an unclear or incomplete explanation in part (c). See solution for details.  PROBLEM 5: No comments here. Good job.  PROBLEM 6: Most groups did well on this problem, also. A few groups got tripped up on part (c) - h1 is best solved for by using Manning's Equation and Continuity.  
1. Figure  1  shows  a  long  wide  rectangular  straight  channel  with  sand  dunes  on  the  bottom. The  dunes  have  a  height  H  = 1  m  and  a  length  λ  =  30  m.  The  average  channel  depth is  hm  = 5  m  and  the  ﬂowrate  per  unit  width  is  q  = 5  m2/s.  The  dune  geometry  can  be simpliﬁed by assuming the downstream slope to be vertical, as shown in the insert.  Account only for headloss in the ﬂow expansion from dune crest to dune through, as represented by the EGL in the insert. a)  Assume  the  water  surface  to  be  straight  and  sloping  by  an  angle  sin β  =  Sf  relative  to horizontal, with Sf  = S0  =average slope of the bottom, and estimate the velocity head over the dune crest and over the dune through.

7. What is double buffering and why is it important in animation?  How do the Swing classes differ from the AWT classes in this respect? Answer: Double buffering is important because it helps to produce a smooth looking animation that does not flicker.  Without double buffering, noticeable flicker will usually result due to the clearing of the background before an animation frame is drawn.  Double buffering is implemented by performing all drawing operations for an animation frame (including clearing the background) in an off-screen image buffer.  Once the complete animation frame has been assembled off-screen, the contents of the image buffer are copied on to the screen. The Swing package provides automatic double buffering capabilities by way of the JComponent class.  With the AWT classes, double buffering is the responsibility of the programmer. Question

1) and the beginning of construction is exactly 18 months.  All of the engineering and architectural work is completed during this period.  b.  The time for construction (from groundbreaking until the time that tenants can move in) is exactly 24 months (i.e. months 19 to 42 of the project if the project is completed on time).  c.  The permanent mortgage is obtained 3 months after the tenants move in (at the end of month 45 if the project is completed on time).    d.  The tenants have 4 months (to fix up the interior) before they make their first rent payment (at the end of month 46 if the project is completed on time). e.  The fixed costs include the land acquisition ($58 million), preparation of the case for    development ($5 million), the architects and engineers fees (assumed to be $90 million of the $145 million for fees and borrowing costs cited in the note), $45 million of the construction costs (for the foundation, landscaping, entry, lobby and the roof), and $5 million of the project management costs.  These fixed costs will not vary if the number of floors is increased or decreased. f.  The $90 million total architect/engineering fees are paid uniformly over the first 18 months of the project; the $145 million total construction costs are paid uniformly over the period of construction. g.  The construction could be stretched out over 3 years with a savings in construction of $5 million and essentially no chance of an overrun. h.  The project costs are provided on a construction loan with interest of 10% per year charged from the point that costs are incurred, compounded monthly. i.  The interest rate of the permanent mortgage is 8%, also compounded monthly. j.  All invoice and loan payments are made on the last day of the month.      k.  Additional space, if available, could likely be rented at $30/sq. ft. per year or more.  Questions  
2.  Project Revenue (20 points) - Assume that the project has one major tenant who pays $26/sq. ft. for 600,000 sq. ft. and another who pays $29/sq.ft for 200,000 sq. ft., while all other space is rented at $30/sq.ft. (these are annual rates per square foot for long-term leases)  a. Calculate the monthly revenue assuming that the building is fully leased from the outset  b. Calculate the PW of the total revenue received over a 30-year project life as of the beginning of the first month in which rents are received (use the owner’s discount rate of 15%)  c. Calculate the PW of the revenue as of the beginning of month 1 (using the owner’s discount rate of 15%)  d. Compare the PW of the costs (from 1b) and the PW of the revenue (from 2c) and discuss whether this is a worthwhile project (from the owner’s perspective).   
3.  Refinancing (10 points) - Once the building is up and rented, the owner can refinance the building at a lower interest rate, because the bankers now can see the completed building and the paying tenants.    a.  Assume that the bank will provide a 30-year mortgage with the maximum amount equal to 80% of the net present value of the rents (calculated with a discount rate equal to the interest rate on the loan).   What would the maximum amount of the mortgage be and what would the monthly mortgage payment be?  b.  Considering the owner’s cash flows and the owner’s discount rate (15%), what is the project now worth to the owner (at the beginning of the first month), assuming that financing will be available?    
4.  Sustainability (10 points) – Identify two major issues related to the social and environmental sustainability of a skyscraper.  Discuss how the design of the project could be altered to make the project more sustainable from both a social and an environmental perspective. (maximum:  1 page)  Questions 1-4 should be answered by each student.  Each student should develop their own spreadsheet and email it to Aaron by class on September 26th. After completing their analyses, students within each team may compare their answers to be sure that they have reasonable results before pursuing question 5, which is a team project.    
5.  Other Issues (30 points) – Group project, to be presented in class.  Group assignments are listed at the end of the assignment.  Each group will deal with ONE of the following sets of issues:  Question 5 should be submitted as a Team in a separate spreadsheet, along with a Powerpoint presentation (September 25th 9pm). Please email Aaron the group Powerpoint presentations (roughly 4-5 minute duration) and Team spreadsheet by 9pm the night before Wednesday’s class (9pm on 25th September).    5A.  Sensitivity to cost assumptions:  how would the total project cost (as calculated in part 1a and the PW (as calculated in part 3b) vary if the: •  Construction costs were higher or lower • •  The time required for construction were higher or lower •  The owner’s discount rate were higher or lower Interest rates for the construction loan were higher or lower 5B. Sensitivity to revenue assumptions and selling the building:   Discuss the implications of this sensitivity analysis.  •  How would the PW of the project vary (as calculated in part 3b) if the rents increased or declined over the 30-year life of the building?  Discuss the implications of this analysis. •  Once the building is refinanced, the owners may get bored simply collecting rents and making mortgage payments.  What price should they offer and what is the minimum price that they should accept?  (Please think carefully about what factors influence a price and remember that the price must be large enough to pay off your mortgage.  “Beauty is in the eye of the beholder.”)     5C. Redesigning the building: suppose that, early in the planning stage, the city planning department offers you a chance to increase the floor area ratio to 15 (which would allow you to add 3 stories and 100,000 sq. ft. of  rentable space).  All you have to do is provide enclosed, all weather walkways to neighboring buildings as part of a "downtown mall" concept.  Building the walkways and adding the extra stories would delay the entire project for 2 months.  How much additional cost would you be willing to incur to build the walkways, given that you would also be able to construct and rent the extra space?  (Be sure to consider effects on both cost and revenue.)  Request from Board of Directors  We have reviewed our plans for evaluating the new skyscraper with our board of directors.   They think the project is pretty good, but they are very worried about risks.  They therefore are anxious to hear the conclusions and recommendations of your sensitivity analyses.  In fact, they worry that the sensitivity analysis fails to go far enough, so they would like you to consider two rather dramatic changes in design:  Our real estate marketing expert is Ken B. Least, whose firm owns several office buildings and is building two new buildings on the other side of town.  He fears that the demand for office space is weakening.  He suggests that we also evaluate a smaller project with only 800,000 sq. feet of rentable space, which would be sufficient for the two major clients we already have and much less risky.  Our project management team indicates that they could finish construction of the smaller building six months earlier with substantial cost savings.  M. I Green, who helps us with our environmental impact assessments, highlighted the growing interest in “sustainability”.  She would like to add some features to the building and its construction to make it more sustainable and therefore a more significant contribution to the city.   She suggests that our major tenant might be willing to pay 20-40% additional rent in order to benefit from the positive publicity associated with an innovative building.  Yu-Pei Me, our architect (and a cousin of I.M. Pei), loves the idea, and she is excited about designing a “very green” building.  Con Kreet, our chief engineer, is less excited, as he believes it would take an extra $100 million and an extra 6 months to construct the “very green” building, while saving only $10 million per year in utilities.   He claims that we could save occupants $5 million per year in utilities simply by cutting back on some of the more grandiose architecture in the current plan.  We could then build the building with no increase in construction time or expense.    We therefore need to expand the scope of our analysis.   Name Angeles, Kathryn Patricia Bajoria, Ankur Chauhan, Siddharth Ching, Kenneth Dantata, Sanusi DeRogatis, Austin Eid, Serge Fitzpatrick, Daniel Fuller, Pierre Fund, Ariane Gamaliel, Renard Ghisbain, Pierre Green, Vanessa Harding, Mary Herrero Lopez, Sergio Hodge, Matt Hopkins, Thomas Kamal, Sameer Kikkawa, Izumi Lame, Ali Lavallee, Phillip Link, Percy Losleben, Tamar Mazzei, David Mikelonis, Anne Nazarchuk, Alex Rahimi, Navid Sgardeli, Georgia-Chrysouli St. Hilaire, Shaun Stevenson, Matthew Swanton, Andrew Sweeney, Raymond Vater, Katherine Wood, Elizabeth Task   5A for base case plus redo 1-4,5A for the smaller building     5B for base case plus redo 1-4,5B for the "very green option"       5C (redo 1-4 for the redesigned building)     5A for base case plus redo 1-4,5A for the "very green option"       5B for base case plus redo 1-4,5B for the "very green option"     5C (redo 1-4 for the redesigned building)       5B for base case plus redo 1-4,5B for the smaller building      5A for base case plus redo 1-4,5A for the smaller building       5B for base case plus redo 1-4,5B for the smaller building     5A for base case plus redo 1-4,5A for the "very green option"   Group   1     2       3     4       5     6       7     8       9     10    The teams should include results for the base case (the building in the Sept. 19th assignment) and for the alternative design in their presentations.   The board did not give specific instructions about what to consider or how to report results.  They clearly would like to know if either option is superior to the original plan.  The analysis will at least have to consider the information they provided, including: For smaller building:  fewer floors will be needed, so construction costs can be reduced.  Rents will only come from two tenants.  Construction takes less time. For very green building:  construction will cost $100 million more and take 6 months longer.  Tenants pay for utilities, and may be willing to pay higher rents.  
1.  Selecting an engineer  Each student should select an engineer from the candidate list (also posted on course website). This should be coordinated by track so that  we receive one master list (student/chasee pairing) per track. Please have one representative from each track send the master lists to us by Friday, 21st September. Then, we would like you to submit a brief memo to Dr. Adams  and  Aaron  stating  who  you  have  selected  and  the  reason  for  yourchoice  by  Friday, 28th September (you may leave a paper copy in the M.Eng room).  
2.   Visiting the engineer  Please  arrange  to  contact  your  chasee  and  arrange  to  visit  them  for  a  half  day.    Many students find that the Columbus Day (Monday, October 8th, 
3. Trip report  Write a trip report (not more than 4 pages double spaced) on your visit, which includes what you learnt about being an engineer and how it is practiced by your chasee. Since many of you have worked previously or are working, your expectations and experiences will differ from those right out of college.  Write a report from your perspective: what did YOU learn? (Note: for HPS and Geotechnical students, please submit individual reports based  on  personal  experiences  from  the  visit,  even  though  some  of  you  are  going  in pairs). Include in your report any updated contact information on your chasee, such as address, phone, email, job title and responsibilities.  The written report is due Seminar 
4.  Thank-you letter  Write a letter of thanks to your chasee (not email).  This is also due October 19th.  Please include a copy for Aaron.

1.  Acquiring knowledge about a particular company and the industry in which it operates is useful for several reasons. First, it provides important information for assessing career opportunities and prospects in various E&C industry sectors and companies. Second, it shows that you are interested in the industry and the company and have made an effort to find out as much about them as you can. Third, it demonstrates your conceptual skills and the fact that you understand the “big picture” and your role in it.  
2.  This assignment is the third and final unit of the Concepts subject’s topic on the Engineering & Construction Industry. The first unit provided an overview of the industry and its participants. The second unit introduced several key concepts related to strategic management in the industry (such as the “Business Idea”, “distinctive competencies”, and “competitive advantage”) and a number of trends, ideas, and forces that appear to be shaping the future business environment of engineering and construction. This final unit gives you the opportunity to use what you learned and focus it on a company of your choice.  
3.  The assignment is as follows:  Written Report: Prepare a 3-4 page report on a company that is of interest to you. At a minimum, the report should describe your view of the company’s business idea, distinctive competencies, competitive advantage and the challenges and issues it might face in the future business environment.   Presentation Slides: Prepare a 5-6 slide presentation (be sure 1 slide provides a list of information sources).  Presentation:  10-12 students will be selected to make 5-6 minute presentations in class on October 31  
4.  Assignment due date: please email slides to Aaron by 7:30AM, Wednesday, October 31, 2007, so he can have them ready for selected in-class presentations starting at 8:30AM.  It would help if you labeled the files using your last name and assignment number, e.g., ChowAssig
1. GENERAL This exercise uses case studies developed by Professor Ronald Buckham, former Director of Professional Engineering Practice Liaison Program at the University of Washington, with his permission. The cases are now found at the National Institute of Engineering Ethics (http://www.niee.org). His explanation of the program (below) provides the motivation for considering applied ethics. Program Incentive: Society tends to hold practicing engineers, associated scientists, architects, and allied design professionals to high standards and expects them to perform on an ethical plane commensurate with their responsibility to the community. This expectation creates a dilemma for the university student and for the practicing design professional, since standards for ethical decision making are seldom addressed in professional training. Program Objective: While there is a wide spectrum of ethics theories available, and growing yearly, many are couched in terms which are difficult for the design professional to apply to the every day, sometimes gut-wrenching circumstances, encountered in professional practice. As a consequence, the focus of this program is to present real situations taken from professional practice in order to stimulate greater emphasis on ethical issues, and to hopefully allow our users an opportunity to avoid similar pitfalls in their own careers. The language used is straight-forward and the solutions provided for consideration are realistic, and, for the most part, practical. The expressed intent of this program is to foster discussion of ethical issues in professional practice and to derive practical solutions to ethical problems for practicing design professionals. 
2. DEBATE ON ETHICS CASES For this assignment, we will explore four case studies through an informal debate. Tasks The attachment to the Assignment consists of four case studies (see listed below). Each case study presents a practical ethical dilemma and several possible solutions. You will be assigned one of the four case studies. You will be required to pick one of the solutions, or devise a new or modified solution, and explain and defend your solution through an ethically based argument. There is no right or wrong answer, so you will be judged on the quality of your argument. State your assumptions and develop a clear, logical argument using the ethics principles listed under "Recommended Core Ethical Values" as a guide. Pay particular attention to the "fidelity" values. You may use other ethical values in your argument. Structure of Debate The class will be divided into eight groups, two for each case study (groups A and B). The members of each group will work together to prepare a solution to their ethical dilemma, which they will present in class. Each group should not reveal its solution to the other groups. Preparation will include one or two slides summarizing the case study, and another two slides presenting the group's solution to the ethical problem. Each group can decide how many presenters to use. The groups in each case study will provide a point-counterpoint for their respective case. For each case, we will flip a coin to determine which of the two groups (A or B) will kick off the presentation. The starting group will present a summary of the case (2 minutes). The second group will provide their solution to the problem (2 minutes). Finally the first group will give a critique of the second group’s solution (agreeing, disagreeing, or a mix, and explaining why), at the end of which they will briefly state their solution (2 minutes). Following this, there will be a brief discussion period open to the whole class (3 minutes). Everyone is responsible for being familiar with all of the case studies (i.e. please also read over the ones you are not presenting). Due to time constraint, we may cut off a team when the time is up. Please remember that the second group is providing a critique of the first group's argument, not simply presenting your own argument. Therefore, the first group should also use the second group's slides to structure their critique, rather than using their own. 
3. GRADING Teams will be graded based on their argument (50%) and their slides (25%). Members of each team will all receive the same grade, regardless of who presents or critiques during the presentation.  Individual students will also be graded for class participation (25%). Questions and comments from the class, after each point and counterpoint presentation, will count toward your class participation grade.  Please email a copy of the slides (Powerpoint) and group report (Word document) to the instructor by 9pm, the night before Lecture

1. a.	 Using  the  data  provided  in  Table  1,  estimate  the  fare  elasticity  of  total  weekday demand for MBTA rail transit service during midday (10am­3pm). b.	 According to this elasticity estimate, is the demand for midday rail transit service elastic or inelastic? Comment on your answer. c.	 How does the elasticity of demand for midday rail transit service vary among the three income groups (low, moderate, and high) for which ridership data are reported in Table 1? Comment on these variations. d.	 Table  1  also  reports  the  prior  behavior  of  MBTA  rail  transit  passengers  traveling  during “Dime  Time”  hours.  Boston’s  regional  transportation  planning  agency  estimated  that 233,760  auto  trips  (including  both  driver  and  passenger  trips)  were  made  in  the  MBTA service area on a typical weekday before the “Dime Time” program began. From these data,  estimate  the  cross  elasticity  of  demand  for  auto  travel  with  respect  to  fare  for midday rail transit trips. How do you interpret the arithmetic sign of this elasticity? e.	 The MBTA estimated that prior to the “Dime Time” experiment, average weekday travel on  the  rail  service  during  peak  periods  (7­10am  and  3­6pm)  was  203,670  passengers. Estimate  the  cross­elasticity  of  demand  for  peak­period  rail  travel  with  respect  to  the off­peak rail fare. f.	 Please answer the following: i.	 What  were  the  total  daily  benefits  to  riders,  as  measured  by  the  increase  in consumer surplus, of the “Dime Time” experiment? How  much  of  the  increase  in  consumer  surplus  represented  fare  savings  to passengers  who  already  traveled  on  the  rail  system  during  the  midday  at  the initial fare of 25 cents? How were the benefits in (ii) divided among riders in the three income groups? How much of the total benefit was received by new riders (who were initially not using  the  T)  who  began  to  use  the  rail  system  when  the  midday  fare  was reduced to 10 cents? How were the benefits in (iv) divided among riders in the three income groups? ii.	iii.	iv.	v.	g.	 Why  is  it  important  to  distinguish  between  consumer  benefits  to  passengers  who  had been  using  the  rail  system  at  the  higher  fare  and  those  received  by  new  riders  who began to use the system in response to the fare change?

4. Pricing a Port Facility This problem is worth 20 points (remember: choose 2 problems from 3, 4, and 
5) In this question we will determine the optimal prices for a port facility under a number of different objectives.  In analyzing the facility, we will use the following variables: •	 P = price of processing one Twent-Foot Equivalent Unit (TEU) through this port, measured in dollars ($) •	 Q = daily demand for port facility, measured in TEU •	 C = daily cost for the port facility, measured in dollars ($) •	 t = average processing time for each TEU, measured in minutes (min) •	 T = total processing time, measured in minutes (min) •	 V = value of time (VOT) for one TEU, as perceived by the customers of the port, measured in dollars per hour ($/hr) The demand, costs, and behavior of the port facility are characterized by the following relationships: Q = 4,000 - 20PC = 50,000 + 15Q + 
1.  In  each  function,  t represents  the  travel  time  on  the  corresponding  link  (in  minutes)  and  x  represents  the  number  of vehicles traveling on that link. Demand on each OD pair is fixed (inelastic) within the study period: •	•	A-C demand = 100 vehicles B-C demand = 250 vehicles Assume that travel on the A-C OD pair is priced at marginal cost. In other words, the 100 vehicles going from A to C are already paying a toll that makes their ‘perceived’ cost of using the direct link between these two nodes equal to marginal cost. Also assume that people traveling on the A-C OD pair have no other choice than to use the direct link (i.e. they will use that link regardless of the level of flow). Your task here is to find tolls that you could charge on the two paths connecting B and C. Under  path-based  congestion  pricing,  each  vehicle  is  charged  based  on  its  OD  pair.  This  means  that there can be two vehicles traveling on the link connecting A and C and paying different tolls because one originated at A, while the other originated at B. Answer the following questions: a.	 Write  an  expression  for  the  optimal  toll  to  be  charged  on  each  path  connecting  the  B-C  OD  pair. b.	Keep in mind the flow on the first OD pair (A-C). (3 points) In order to  find the  value  of the  two  tolls, you will need to  calculate  equilibrium  levels of flow  on each  of  the  two  paths.  Assume  this  equilibrium  is  reached  when  the  perceived  cost  of  travel  (i.e. travel time + toll) on both paths are equal. What is the value of the toll on each path if the value of time is $9 per hour? (6 points) c.	 Tolls are usually charged either to make road users choose a different path (route) or to make them switch modes and use public transportation. Sketch a nested model structure that could be used to 4 predict people’s choices for travel between B and C. The alternative modes available are (

What would you expect the overall share of trips for these alternatives for a set of students facing these choices, and explain why?  Question 3B (40%)  Regulatory Effects on Carrier Costs & Decisions:  in a regulated transportation system, a public agency often determines whether or not to grant operating authority to additional firms to serve a particular market.  In such a system operating authorities can have substantial value, because they tend to limit competition and allow carriers to make a reasonable return on their investment.  In such a system, a company may decide if it no longer wants to serve a market.  It might then be able to sell its operating authority (just the piece of paper – not any equipment or facilities!) for a considerable sum of money, as illustrated in this example.  The new operator can then determine how best to serve the market.  (All questions have equal credit: 10%)  
1.  Identify the travel options available to such a traveler and for each option determine/estimate the cost, time and other relevant attributes which might affect the travel choices. Remember that for most intercity trips there is an urban trip at both ends to complete the origin to destination travel. 
2.  Select the option which would be best for you and explain your choice. Think carefully about how you made your decision. 
3.  Deduce what you can about the relative importance of different trip attributes and the specific choices to you. Consider both the intercity leg and the urban legs of your trip. 
4.  Develop a nested logit model structure describing the choices available and explain why you have selected this structure. Discuss explicitly the violations of the i.i.d. assumption of the error term in the standard multinomial logit model which your proposed structure attempts to deal with. 
5.  Deduce what you can about the relative importance of different trip attributes to different types of travelers from Boston to Washington DC. Typical travelers would include business travelers, leisure travelers both single and in groups.

4. You can transport using the new larger container ships from the Port of New York and New Jersey to the Port of Long Beach. However, since these ships cannot pass through the current-day Panama Canal, they must travel around Cape Horn on the southern tip of South America in order to go from the East Coast of the U.S. to the West Coast.  Assume that the shipper and the receiver have only truck access. For Options 3 and 4, assume a truck move is needed to move the containers from the shipper to the containerships and to the receiver from the containerships.  Please respond to the following questions, using the number of points for each to guide your level of effort.  a) Discuss the way you would go about choosing among these four transportation options stating your results both in text and in a series of algebraic equations. You don’t have to indicate your choice but rather just make clear how you would choose. You will have to make various assumptions about the operation of these various transportation links and the logistics systems of the shipper and receiver of the goods. Please document them carefully. (3 points)  b) Now suppose we fast forward ten years into the future, and the Panama Canal has been expanded as planned. Now the larger ships of Option 4 can pass through the canal.  This will change some of the parameters in your algebraic equations from a) above. Discuss which ones will change and the direction of that change and the implications for your mode choice, reflecting the new realities of East Coast to West Coast freight transportation services. Again, document any assumptions. (2 points)  c) Now consider this from the point of view of the containership operator. Explain how the expansion of the Panama Canal would impact on the fleet composition decisions the fleet owner would make. In this case, simply use text. Please note that, of course, the fleet owner has customers other than the one above and serves other origin-destination pairs. (1 point)  
1.  The nation of Panama – You are a special assistant to the President of Panama and he has asked you to put together a policy memo describing the implications on Panama of various strategic alternatives for the Panama Canal studied in 6A. You recognize that how Panama chooses to advance will have important economic implications but will likely have some environmental implications as well. Please write the policy memo discussing these issues, as well as other perspectives you feel may be important. Recommend to the President what is the appropriate way forward for Panama.  
2.  The Union Pacific Railroad (UP) – The UP is among the largest railroads in the United States. While it does not itself provide coast-to-coast transportation service, it, together with other railroad and trucking partners, does provide services of that nature. Clearly what Panama decides to do relative to the Panama Canal will have implications on the market for freight transportation and for the UP.  As a special assistant to the president of the UP, you are asked to write a memo that discusses the implications of various strategies undertaken by Panama on your market, what strategic alternatives are available for you to consider from the railroad’s point of view, and what you recommend UP should do.   
3.  The World Trade Organization. The WTO is directly concerned with the development of the global economy and also other globally scaled issues, including climate change. The WTO has publicly espoused the concept of sustainability, which requires the balanced consideration of economic development, environmental impact, and social equity.   You are the special assistant to the chief executive officer of the WTO. She asks you to write a policy memo that discusses the sustainability implications of the various Panama Canal strategies and recommends what the public posture of the WTO should be relative to this major initiative.

1. Introduction This is a ‘warm-up’ homework that draws on the prerequisite knowledge of Java for this class.  If your Java knowledge is rusty, or if you’re coming from C++ or C# or C, this homework is intended to exercise the parts of the Java language we’ll use most frequently this semester, and will give you a chance to brush up on your skills and get help.   If you are not yet comfortable programming in Java, you may do problem set 1 in another programming language such as C, C++, C# or VB.NET. Please contact the instructor for permission to do this. This option exists only for homework 
2. Problem statement The algorithm you’ll use in homework 1 is simple; it’s up to you to design it, as will be the case during the entire term. It will probably be a ‘greedy algorithm’, which we’ll cover later;  you  don’t  need  to  do  any  analysis  or  proofs  for  it.  Use  your  intuition  to  find  a reasonable way to solve this problem. Amtrak has 20 Acela trainsets. We have provided the weekday schedule for Acela Express trains between Boston, New York,  and  Washington.  (The  departure  and  arrival  times  are  given  to  the  nearest  hour.) You  can  download  the  schedule  from  the  course  web  site.  It  is  under    Homework  -> Homework 
3. Assignment Compute the number of trainsets required to provide the existing service, under varying assumptions  of  turnaround  times  at  each  terminal.    Compute  the  number  of  train  sets required at turnaround times of 1 hour, 2 hours and 3 hours. The turnaround time is the time from the set’s arrival at a final terminal (Washington, Boston, or New York) until its next  departure  time  in  the  opposite  direction.    For  example,  if  a  train  set  arrives  at  a terminal  at  11am,  with  a  one  hour  turnaround  it  can  depart  at  noon,  with  a  2  hour turnaround it can depart at 1pm, and with a 3 hour turnaround it can depart at 2pm. The turnaround time provides a buffer for late arrivals and for train servicing. For this program: •	 The input is the existing schedule and the three possible turnaround times •	 The output is the number of train sets required, and which trips each train set covers.  For  each  trip,  output  the  trip  origin,  departure  time,  destination  and arrival time. If a train is running from Boston to Washington it does not incur any turnaround time in New York; this is an intermediate point on the route and the train continues its run in the same direction after a fairly short stop.  However, if a train is running only between Boston and New York, or New York and Washington, and it turns around in New York, then it does incur turnaround time. Homework  1  is  a  job  scheduling  problem,  of  which  we’ll  see  other  examples.  The homework 1 problem is to find the optimal (least) number of machines to do a set of jobs. The  machines  are  train  sets,  and  the  jobs  are  train  trips  in  the  schedule.  The  schedule defines a set of precedence relationships among jobs, in both time and space. Each job has a start time, end time and a pair of locations. Turn In

1. Problem statement You receive data from a series of satellites on cloud cover and atmospheric temperatures on a near-real-time basis.  Each satellite transmits a series of data points, represented as an array, for the areas it can observe.  There are multiple satellites; sometimes their measurement areas overlap, and sometimes there are gaps. To simplify the problem, we will assume that the data can be sorted by one dimension (longitude) instead of two (latitude and longitude). The satellites report their data at approximately the same time, and you must merge all the data you receive into a single array, sorted by longitude. The order in which the satellites report appears random. They all report within a few seconds or even milliseconds of each other, but the order is essentially unpredictable since it’s based on their distance from the ground station, the processing time on the satellite to compute the measurements and the number of measurements to transmit. This is a common problem in monitoring and analyzing sensor data.  To solve it, you will implement an optimal merge algorithm as outlined in the Horowitz text in section 
2. Algorithm a. Merging two arrays Section 
3. You will need to write the merge method (described in part a above). Implement the pseudocode shown above. Your merge method should take two arrays of type Comparable as its arguments, and return an array of type Comparable as its result. 
4. Use the Heap class provided in lecture to manage the nodes.  Heap.java, provided in lecture, is a max heap, and for algorithm you need a min heap, in which the value of the parent element is smaller than its children. In a min heap, the root element is the smallest element in the heap. It’s probably easiest to modify the code from class to create a new class MinHeap; it requires reversing a few inequalities. You can also use the existing Heap.java code, with appropriate design of the compareTo() method in the objects that you keep in the heap. 
5. We give you part of Java class MergeTest.  It contains a method randomGenerator(), which generates an array of random satellite data. The size of this array is between 1 and 
1. Problem statement The most widely used scheduling technique is the critical path method (CPM) for scheduling, often referred to as critical path scheduling. This method calculates the minimum completion time for a project along with the possible start and finish times for the project activities. The critical path represents the set or sequence of predecessor/successor activities which will take the longest time to complete. The duration of the critical path is the sum of the activities' durations along the path. Thus, the critical path can be defined as the longest possible path through the "network" of project activities. The duration of the critical path represents the minimum time required to complete a project. Any delays along the critical path imply that additional time would be required to complete the project. Table 1 gives an example project: TABLE 1  Precedence Relations and Durations for a Nine Activity Project Example Predecessors  Duration Activity Description Site clearing A Removal of trees B C General excavation D  Grading general area E F G H I Excavation for trenches Placing formwork and reinforcement for concrete Installing sewer lines Installing other utilities Pouring concrete --- --- A A B, C B, C D, E D, E F, G 4 3 8 7 9 12 2 5 6 The critical path schedule solution for this project is given below: Activity A B C D E F G H Duration D(i) 4 3 8 7 9 12 2 5 Earliest start time E(i) 0* 0 4* 4 12 12* 21 21 Latest finish time LF(i) 4* 12 12* 22 22 24* 24 30 Latest start time LS(i) 0 9 4 15 13 12 22 25 I 6 24 30* 24 *Activity on a critical path since E(i) + D(i) = LF(i).

At a minimum, output the critical path tasks: their sequence, durations and the length of the critical (minimum) path.  Optionally output the earliest start time and latest finish time for each task.

2) Value: 8 points In this assignment, you will write a paper that relates important general transportation system concepts to a particular transportation system or situation of your choice.  This assignment is meant to get you thinking about the important issues and questions that must be taken into account when designing or evaluating a transportation system. The “Critical Issues in Transportation” and “The Secretary’s Vision”articles (see Reader) offer a number of broad transportation issues for consideration as well as more specific challenges contained within each of those issues.  The articles can provide a useful starting point for your own paper, although you should feel free to introduce other concepts and issues that go beyond the issues identified in these two readings. Transportation systems are broad in impact, dynamic over time and often multimodal and intermodal.  Identify the most important aspects of your system.  Discuss how you might change the system to improve its performance and, if appropriate, assess the difference between the short-term and long-term effects. You may choose to conduct additional research to enhance your knowledge of the system and your discussion.  Please include a reference list with your assignment. The page limit for this assignment is five pages (not including the reference list), so keep your thoughts organized and clear.  Focus on the quality of presentation of your ideas as well as the substance. When you make your selection of a transportation system, contact Professor Sussman and the TA to give us an opportunity to comment.

5.  Innovation. The port’s main function is to efficiently transition freight between different modes of transportation or vehicles including ships, cranes, trucks and trains.  Consider this aspect to be “mobility” (USDOT) or “global connectivity” (TRB Executive Committee).  The port’s operation is committed to moving freight to satisfy the needs of its customers: the suppliers, distributors and end-users of the cargo.  To do this, the port needs to minimize congestion throughout the system and invest in additional resources to meet growing capacity demands. National security must be a major concern at the port.  First, the port is a physical resource on which our economy depends and could be a target for terrorism.  Maintaining a secure facility is imperative to the operation.

Of course, not all key points are equally relevant. Indeed, some  may  be  irrelevant  to  this  particular  system.  Choose  the  key  points  you think are most applicable. Explain your rationale for choosing the key points you select  and  clearly  discuss  how  each  selected  key  point  applies  in  this  case.  In addition,  discuss  connections  between  your  key  points  where  appropriate,  and the effects one may have on the other(s).

1. Introduction Welcome  to  the  Mexico  City  Metropolitan  Area,  one  of  the  world’s  largest  and  most historically significant cities.  Centuries ago, Aztecs built an empire at Tenochtitlán that would later be conquered by a wave of Spanish explorers.  Built subsequently atop the Aztec ruins, Mexico City today emerges as a city of layers: cultural layers, architectural layers, ethnic layers, geographic layers, and economic layers. Modern  Mexico  City  is  plagued  by  a  number  of  potentially  disastrous  natural  and human  crises:  the  Popocatépetl  volcano,  earthquakes, land  subsidence,  traffic congestion,  and,  perhaps  most  notably,  air  pollution.    In  fact,  one  of  the  most  visible “layers”  in  Mexico  City  is  the  thermal  inversion  layer,  a  thick  layer  of  airborne contaminants that sticks close to the ground most days as cold air at lower elevations becomes trapped by warmer air at higher elevations.  Adding to the problem is a ring of mountains  which  nearly  encircles  the  Valley  of  Mexico,  leaving  little  opportunity  for pollutants  to  escape.  The  high  base  elevation  of  Mexico  City  (about  7500  feet  above MSL)  further  compounds  the  air  quality  problem  due  to  lower  concentrations  of oxygen, which makes tuning of vehicle engines for optimal performance a challenging and costly task. Although levels of some pollutants have declined in the last decade, Mexico City’s air quality problem remains at a near-crisis stage.  Exposure to pollutants is responsible for disease and chronic illness in children and the elderly; meanwhile severe pollution days and worker sick-days often inhibit the ability of Mexicans to work, thereby constraining economic growth. Figure 1A is a topographic map of the Valley of Mexico, looking southeast.  The two high peaks are the volcano Popocatépetl (right) and the peak of Iztaccihuatl (left).  The “Valley  of  Mexico”  describes  the  flat  basin  at  center.    The  Mexico  City  Metropolitan Area (MCMA) covers much of the Valley of Mexico and is sometimes also called the “Zona  Metropolitana  del  Valle  de  México”  (ZMVM).    In  this  assignment  statement, “Mexico City” and MCMA are used interchangeably.

3.  Canada’s  major  airline,  Air  Canada,  a  private  company,  has  filed  for  bankruptcy protection. 
4. Western Canadian farmers want money for freight rail subsidies. This is a classic case of the Complex, Large, Integrated, Open Systems (CLIOS) problem that a 21st Century transportation professional could encounter. As you learned from Key Point #2, transportation service is part of a broader system – economic, social, and political in nature.  This Key Point is very relevant in the context of Canadian  national  politics  since  any  national  transportation  decision  will  take  into consideration many political and economic issues specific to Canada.  The object of this assignment is to provide a realistic simulation of real-world issues, both transportation and non-transportation related.   This  assignment  has  a  quantitative  and  a  qualitative  requirement.    The  quantitative requirement  involves  analyzing  the  facts  and  figures  provided  to  you  in  appendixes  1 through 5 and using this information in order to study the options.  It will be up to you to determine which information is relevant and which is not necessary.   You  will  then  write  a  qualitative  analysis.  To  help  you  understand  the  context  of  the national environment that you are evaluating, ten newspaper articles highlighting issues involving the major Canadian cities will be provided (as appendixes 6 through 
1. 	 Discuss the important technological issues facing Acela.  Hint:  take a look ahead at Key Point 
2. 	 Discuss the decision to choose Bombardier and the institutional issues surrounding it.  Hint:  take a look ahead at Key Point 
3. 	 Discuss why you thing Amtrak chose Boston to New York as its first application for Acela. (2 points, one page maximum) As with Assignment 1, clarity and presentation will be factored into the grading of this assignment. 
1) why intercity rail is so successful in countries such as Japan, Germany, France and others and so unsuccessful in the U.S.; 
2) how Amtrak relates to larger issues such as urban form. Your task is to take some of the 30 Key Points and relate them to this transportation system.  Of course, not all key points are equally relevant.  Indeed, some may be irrelevant to this particular system.  Choose the key points you think are most applicable.  Explain your rationale for choosing the key points you select and clearly discuss how each selected key point applies in this case.  In addition, discuss connections between your key points where appropriate, and the effects one may have on the other(s). Use the article given in Assignment 2A, as well as several other articles attached here, as sources of information for your paper.  Feel free to conduct additional research to aid in the formulation of your thoughts.  Further information on the key points can be found in the lectures and the readings, while additional details on the U.S. rail transportation system can be found in many online resources.  Lexis-Nexis (web.lexis-nexis.com/ universe) is an excellent searchable database for newspaper and journal articles.  If you are unfamiliar with Lexis-Nexis, please see the TA, for assistance. The assignment has a maximum page limit of twelve pages (not including the reference list),

In addition, if the carriers bid on all the combinations, you will have a greater search-space over which to look for an optimal solution, hopefully giving you a lower total cost
1. Reliefs should not occur between 7-9 AM and 4-6PM. P
2. No piece of work should be shorter than 3 hours. For an 8-hour day, 5-day week duty, no piece should be longer than 5 hours. A tolerance of 6 minutes beyond these requirements is taken as acceptable. A. For this part assume that no tripper runs are allowed. (
3) Solve the problem as an IP with only these full-timer runs.  B. We now permit some tripper runs. (

8) Suppose  instead  of  using  trippers,  the  transit  agency  has  the  option  to  use  operators working  up  to  10  hours  a  day  but  just  4  days  per  week.  The  work  rules  for  10-hour operators are also included in the Appendix. In addition, for 10-hour runs only, a piece of work  should  be  no  shorter  than  4  hours  and  no  longer  than  6  hours.  Remember:  NO trippers are allowed. (i)  On Sheet “10-Hour”, you are provided with all possible additional partitions for all vehicle  blocks  except  block  B8,  for  which  some  additional  partitions  may  exist. Possible  runs  for  8-hour  and  10-hour  operators  associated  with  the  pieces  from  the provided  partitions  are  on  Sheet  “Form  10”.  Enumerate  any  possible  additional partitions for block B8 and generate all possible runs associated with the pieces from the  additional  partitions  for  both  8-hour  and  10-hour  duties.  Please  mark  your partition(s) and runs generated. (ii) Generate the trip-run matrix, and implement the set partition model and solve the IP to get the crew schedule for a single day.

These approaches  were  based  on  the  premise  that  maintenance  routing  is  strictly  a  feasibility problem. How would each of these four approaches be impacted if we were to modify the problem  to  incorporate  an  objective  function  in  the  maintenance  routing  problem?  For example,  assume  each  route  string  r  had  a  cost  cr.  How  would  you  compare  the  four approaches now? Appendix  Work Rules A. For an 8-hour day 5-day week operator (

1.  The key location for traffic counts is the 3-way intersection of Columbia Street, Main Street, and Mass. Ave. Traffic counts and observations can be done in groups. You may discuss your observations within the group, but write your memo individually. Try to apply the planning framework presented in class to the issues you see at Mass Ave between Lafayette Square and Memorial Drive.  The intent of this assignment is to go beyond the observations about throughput and capacity of Assignment #1, and consider the physical street design as well as the broader political and institutional context of Mass Ave.  State and federal funds that pass through the state are financing the reconstruction, and the responsible state agency (MassHighway) has strongly influenced the design of the plan, as has the City of Cambridge with support from MIT.      Your memo should advise Gottleib on whether to intervene and how. 2(cid:

1) The core of this case is the interplay of the two “commons,” the Concrete Commons expansion implementation machine CONNDOT wants to build a project conceptualized in an earlier period, before significant  public  concern  with  the  Green  Commons  generated  new  policy  and  implementation mechanisms, and more recent strengthened powers of DEP to protect the Green Commons. The  expansion  culture  is  embedded  in  CONNDOT;  they  think  sequentially  of  a  pipeline  of projects where one phase must follow another to justify that the earlier step wasn’t “wasted.” Environmental  Impact  Statements  are  done  ex post  facto  to  bless  conceptual  decisions  already made, and once they have plans ready to build they consider it wasteful not to build them.  CONNDOT has (from their point of view) been through all of the steps, including buying the land and designing the road, so they cannot imagine doing other than building it.  From their point of view, the new law threatens this inexorable sequence, so they seek to reduce new environmental law and regulation to bureaucratic processes  that  do  not  change  the  outcome.    In  this  case,  their  definition  of  “feasible  and  prudent”  is designed so that there never will be a “feasible and prudent alternative.” For DEP, defending the Green Commons is the job, so it is essential to set precedents, which will make the environmental process meaningful and change the outcome to preserve and enhance the Green Commons.  The  genuine  thoughtful  consideration  before  defining  the  problem,  actually  considering alternatives, along with any adverse environmental consequences and choosing options which reasonably solve the problem with lesser adverse impacts, and mitigating those adverse impacts that are unavoidable, is a fundamental shift in the decision-making process that DEP must encourage CONNDOT to embrace. 1 (
2) At  the  same  time,  DEP  needs  to  recognize  that  many  of  the  tendencies  towards  sprawl  are embedded in other government institutions such as zoning and tax policy, beyond the direct control of CONNDOT  and  unlikely  to  change  because  of  the  simple  denial  or  approval  of  this  one  permit.    To impact institutional elements beyond the direct control of CONNDOT requires strengthening the overall political  will  to  change  these  deeply  embedded  perverse  policies.    This  entails  responding  to  and supporting the constituencies that have committed themselves to support stricter environmental laws and their  enforcement  (which  inevitably  includes  elements  of  both  NIMBY  and  NOPE)  while  at  least attempting to not so inflame the growth machine that anti-environmental backlash actually weakens the overall  political  will  to  protect  the  Green  Commons  and  possibly  lead  to  weakening  of  environmental powers and/or the appointment of environmental officials who are afraid to enforce the law.  This cannot mean failing to enforce the law out of fear that the backlash will lead to the removal of either the law or the  commissioner  whenever  the  “growth  machine”  is  well-organized  and  energized;  that  is  a  slippery slope  that  leads  to  bad  precedents  and  continued  bad  practice  everywhere  by  CONNDOT  and  other institutions, and actually incentivizes political organization to circumvent the implementation of the law. But it does mean using such high visibility cases to not only enforce the law but do so in a manner that builds the political will of environmentalists and converts some of the opponents to the support of Green Commons by strategies which actually help and respect the Concrete Commons as well, so that support for  both  environmental  law  and  the  strict  enforcement  of  the  law  and  the  support  and  survival  of  the commissioner  who  seriously  enforces  the  law  is  an  essential  part  of  the  job.    Both  blind  and  narrow enforcement  of  the  law  in  a  manner  that  leads  to  loss  of  support  for  environmental  principles,  or flamboyant enforcement of the law in a sort of romantic heroic image of intentionally courting dismissal, weaken the overall political strength of environmental protection, so the objective needs to be a decision which sets good precedent, supports the pro-environment constituencies, and is reasonable enough in tone and process to encourage those who may disagree to stay within the process. 2 (
3) In  deciding  on  a  course  of  action,  it  is  essential  to  have  a  clear  understanding  of  the  relative strength  and  power  of  both  CONNDOT  and  DEP,  and  find  ways  to  use  CONNDOT’s  power  and resources to augment those of DEP in achieving good environmental outcomes.  This cannot mean DEP becoming the transportation planning agency, or “collaborating” on every project.  DEP doesn’t have the resources  to  participate  across  the  board  at  that  level.    DEP  does  have  the  power  to  establish  clear precedents and enforce them, and to require mitigation on any unavoidable adverse impacts, and it can use these powers both to achieve reasonable outcomes on the specific case and to set robust precedent. Keeping these three primary general considerations in mind, what are some of the most salient factors in this case? B. Factors in Super 7 Case (

5) 	Political Realities of the Situation (A)  	The  Governor’s  position  is  ambiguous,  Senator  Ribikoff  is  clearly  against,  several mayors are taking inconsistent positions, and the referenda in the towns show negative grass roots sentiment, so the political situation is uncertain enough that the commissioner has options.

Think about what objectives the MBTA and the operator are likely to  have  and  examine  the  explicit  and  implicit  incentives  and  penalties  built  into  the contract.   If there were the opportunity to change any of the proposed terms in a new contract  negotiation,  and  if  you  were  representing  the  MBTA,  what  terms  would  you seek to alter, and in what way?  If you were the operator, what terms would you seek to alter?  Provide appropriate supporting arguments. Briefly  discuss  the  difficulties  the  MBTA  is  likely  to  face  in  monitoring  contractor performance and administering the contract.   Provide a brief assessment of the transitional difficulties the MBTA should expect to face if in the future it decided to change the contractor.  How significant a problem might this be, in terms of the overall effectiveness of this contracted service?  Can you think of any strategies the MBTA might take to minimize this concern?

Demand for the item is random but stationary and non-seasonal at a rate of 16,000 units per year.  The unalterable policy on this item is to set an order quantity equal to 25% of annual demand (i.e., 4,000 units per order).  Forecasted lead time demand is about 700 units.  Our demand forecasting algorithm has been generating forecast RMSE of 150 units for this item.  Lead time usage forecast errors can be assumed to be approximately normally distributed.  Demands which occur during a system stockout become either backorders or lost sales.  On a random basis, about 70% of all shortages become lost sales at a cost of $

4.  For a company that ships bulk chemicals, it might appear counter-intuitive that warehouse replenishment is made using plastic totes rather than larger single tank bulk trucks.  A couple of years ago ChemCo decided to switch from replenishing their warehouses with bulk trucks to totes mainly due to the greater availability of both common dry van transportation and public storage.  The public warehouses generally allow storage of chemicals in these totes while restricting (or charging much more for) large fixed tanks.  Using totes instead of bulk tanks, however, does involve additional packaging and lustrated in Exhibit

1. A demand forecasting system  Pat, your manager, has returned from an MIT course, excited at having learned about new methods of demand forecasting for your organization.  Your manager calls a meeting about the new project.  “This demand forecasting system, which we’re buying from a vendor but also modifying for our organization, is critical to our future.  We’ve anticipated demand changes very poorly in the past, and we have not had sufficient capacity in the right places at the right time to meet our customers’ needs.  I know that our organization hasn’t supported logistics and transportation system efforts very well in the past, so this time we’ll give you everything you need.  You’ll have good office space, good servers and software support, and you won’t have to attend most of the regular staff meetings.”  “That sounds excellent,” you say.  “My staff, which is all recent MIT SM grads, is really enthusiastic. They don’t have as much experience as I’d like, but their energy and smarts will more than make up for it.  I’ll get commitments from them to work really hard in exchange for allowing them to be really creative, so that we complete the project on time.”  “I’ve budgeted this as an 8 month project, and I’ve promised the Board of Directors that we’ll be done on time,” Pat said.  “This is a very high visibility effort.”  Alex, from QA, says, “If we’re going to be using the system at the 8 month point, we need to have the software frozen at the 6 month mark, so we can write the test scripts.  Since your system will interface with our current customer measurement software and our geographic information system (GIS), we’ll need time to test the interfaces.”  Chris, from training, also chimes in: “We’ll need the system frozen at the 6 month point also, to prepare training materials for the staff.”  You agree to the 6 month freeze.  As your staff of 4 analysts begins the project, they’re very energized by the challenge and the freedom of the effort.  They split up the project into pieces: Joe defined the interfaces with the other systems, and Karen designed the database and system interface components to achieve this.  Kate configured the statistical modules of the vendor-supplied package, and specified some additional analytics that Jim would write as extensions.  Karen liked to design user interfaces, so she took on that task.  You managed the project using a spreadsheet and simple project management software (Microsoft Project).  The staff took one month to be trained in the new software and to talk to the groups who did the current customer measurement and GIS systems. They discovered that most, but not all, the data needed to improve the demand forecasts was available, and that some 1existing data was coded incorrectly and grouped in ways that didn’t work well.  They negotiated changes with the customer measurement and GIS system groups, who promised the changes would be complete in two months (at the 3 month point in the project).  The interfaces had to be redesigned when the other groups completed their work. Because they had to make the changes quickly, the other groups tweaked the existing interfaces and queries to produce what was needed, even though in some cases much more data was sent than needed, and in other cases, the data had to be reorganized within the demand forecasting system to be usable.  This took all of month 4, and a few compromises had to be made.  The statistics modules then had to be redesigned because the compromises affected the models; this took month 5, and then month 6 to take care of some nagging problems. There were still a few spots that didn’t seem to work properly, but the staff could make them work with care.  The user interface then had to be redesigned, and this took through month 
2. Demand forecasting system, version 3  After a very shaky implementation of the first version of the demand forecasting system, the organization decided to upgrade it in next year’s work plan. This didn’t go very well either, but the system was more usable and more stable after a 12-month effort (that had, again, been scheduled for 8 months.)  To correct still more problems, Pat asked you to make recommendations for version 3, now that everyone had two years of experience with the system.  You were given a month to do the assessment.  Your report recommended that you rewrite major portions of the model.  More GIS data was necessary than you had initially expected in version 1:  -  Users wanted reports of demand changes overlaid on a map, not in text system focus.  The vendor system didn’t support this very well.  Pat approved the approach; you had two of the original team members and two new team members for version 3; you estimated it would take 12 months, given past experience.  Pat said you had to deliver in 11 months, so the Board could be sure the project was complete during this budget cycle and could be included in the annual report.  You agree.  You estimated each part of the project with 30% more time than in versions 1 or 2, which would cover the overruns you had seen.  However, when the team began working on version 3, tasks turned out to be more complicated than expected.  The new team members took a long time to become familiar with version 2 of the system because it wasn’t well documented.  Tasks were taking about 60% longer, not 30% longer than versions 1 or

8) “Well, you really shouldn’t need two months for just QA and training. It shouldn’t take 25% of the effort just to do that; we’ve been busting our butts to build all this.  You can do it in one month.”  You go to your boss, and say that you really need her support in this, and that she’d promised you a lot of support for this project. She reluctantly agrees, and tells QA and training they have to be done in one month. (
9)  She tells the Board the project is still on schedule.    Your team finally finished the first version of the customized software at the 8 month point and hands it over to QA and training.  They can’t get the system to run properly.  Your staff sits with them and points out all the parameters that must be set in just one way, and the exact sequence in which all the analyses must be run.  It’s very complex, and QA and training both say that the users can’t deal with it.  (
10) Also, any small error results in system crashes or crazy results.   An impasse results; you all meet with Pat the next week, during month 
11.  “Even though you are familiar with the GIS and customer management systems, and the vendor forecasting system, you still don’t have management control of the effort.  Surprises will crop up because of inadequate process; you can’t make design tradeoffs because you don’t know what they are; QA is still inadequate because it’s left to the end; and there are many other problems.”  Bill continues, “Version 3 will be a better system: it will be easier to use, because you understand your users; it will integrate with the other systems better, because you understand them better.  But it will still have quality problems and you’ll be late because of the lack of good process.”  Questions. Answer each in a sentence or two. Be prepared to discuss them in class.  a. At the 4 month point, what do you, Pat, do?  You can have some additional resources; specify those you would like to have.  b. With your suggested actions, will you be able to deliver the system on time, in 11 months?  Why or why not?  c.

1. Automated location data on public transit vehicles (35%)   Your company just received a contract to develop an automated vehicle location system for a transit agency.  GPS receivers and wireless modems are being placed on all buses in the fleet  and will report location data every minute.  The agency has retained your company to write the system to display the data in a Web-based system.  The selection committee thought your proposal was wonderful, and it additionally wanted to  interface your system to the farebox on the bus. This would provide an estimate of how full  the bus is, which is useful for passengers waiting to board at locations where they can choose  to take a different route, or where they can wait for a near-empty bus closely following a full bus.  You had written your proposal as a stand-alone system without the ability to interface with other systems.  The project is 18 months in duration and you have been asked if you can add the extra interface within that time.  You meet with your boss the next day, who had participated in the final presentations and  question-answer period.  She believes that you will need to implement the farebox interface to  win the project, and that the revised budget and schedule cannot be much greater than those in the current proposal.  The two of you discuss it for an hour, and you agree to a 21 month effort (versus 
2. Manufacturing process software (15%)  Your company had hired a large IT consulting firm to build a specialized software system for your manufacturing plants.  You had examined off-the-solutions, but none had the ability to  process the unique products that you make. Your products are assembled from a large set of  standard components in a custom configuration for every customer.  No off-the-shelf system  allowed you to track the components, assemblies and connectors in a way that interfaced with  your robotic production clusters; no off-the-shelf system allowed your customers and you to  record past product customization so it could easily be reused in future orders for similar (but not identical) products.  The large IT firm used an “agile” process. The initial versions of the plant software were done quickly but were so simplified that it was hard for your staff to even comment on them. However, it was taking a very long time for your staff to educate the IT firm on the complexities that the real plant software would have to handle, and initial versions from the  IT firm were very weak.  The project was scheduled to produce initial software that could be installed in the plant in 12   months. After 6 months of work, it seemed that 80% of the effort had been spent educating  the outside firm.  No usable requirements, designs or software had been produced. You meet  with your boss to discuss options.                                                                         2               Your boss asks you to write a memo, no more than one page, double-spaced, to list at least two options that you believe will allow the manufacturing software to be built in  12 months. If you feel 12 months is infeasible, provide a better schedule estimate.  Briefly describe the key problems to be resolved, and how each of your options addresses them.  Recommend one option to your boss.    Your memo must be well-reasoned and well-written. It is often effective to describe the  decision issues and summary of conclusions at to the start of the memo.  There is not a single answer to these questions; you should provide a reasoned response,  referencing material in McConnell. Cover only the major points.

1. Automated data collection from transit vehicles (35%)  The main points of the solution should be:  
2.  With a 21 month schedule, a spiral model should have been used, bringing the system to a deliverable state every few months. You are implicitly using a waterfall model, which does not manage risk well.  
3.  Schedule is apparently the most important driver, and designing to schedule is probably the best approach, which is well supported by the spiral model.  (You can also argue that cost is the key driver, but the case study notes that the transit agency is unhappy about the schedule, not the cost.  You might convince them to increase the cost more easily than to slip the schedule.) 
4.  The team size should have been reviewed to ensure it fit with the project scope.  This was not done.  Almost certainly, the team needed another member to work on the farebox interface, and perhaps more.  The effort should have been re-estimated, even if very approximately. 
5.  The project requirements were not rewritten; the project was not re-scoped with the new schedule in mind.  Your team will work at a nominal rate at best, not fastest possible or efficient.  You should re-estimate the project size (lines of code), schedule and team size. 
6.  The addition of an interface to a vendor with no participation in the project was a significant risk that should have had a management strategy. The transit agency should have been asked to accept some or most of the risk of their farebox vendor not performing.  A risks list is important right from the start of the project. 
7.  You don’t really control the software process; it is at level 1 (chaos).  You should be at CMMI level 2 or 3, and should devote some resources at the start of the project to measure the resources, size, quality and other variables of the effort. 
8.  At the 6 month point, you have 15 months until the 21 point initial delivery point, which is often plenty of time to save a project. You can do three 5-month spirals, or more short spirals, to incrementally build the system.  QA and documentation will get interim releases that they can use to test and write documentation.  You can learn about other risks; you can find items to cut in each spiral, etc.  You can simulate the 1farebox, per the published interface, to decouple your effort from the farebox vendor.  If you deliver your software that works with the simulator, it’s then the farebox vendor’s problem to fix their software.  
9.  In summary, the solution to these problems is a better software process based on developing good requirements, good designs, using the time and resource estimation methods to plan and scope the work, and using the spiral model and supporting methods to manage the implementation. 
10. The process must involve top management, who must buy into the principles and the need to have software process; it must involve the transportation planning and business staff, who need to understand the process and their role in it; and, of course, it must involve the software staff.   
1.  Chemical inventory system  Chris was in charge of version 1 of MIT’s chemical inventory system, MITCIS. With higher security required these days, MIT realized that its decentralized system of ordering, delivering and disposing of chemicals had to change. Chris had a general idea of the capabilities necessary from his past experience and from the first meeting of the MIT steering committee for the project.  Dave was the head of the committee.  “Chris, how long is MITCIS going to take, he asked?”  “I think it will take about 9 months, but that’s just a rough estimate at this point,” Chris said.  “That’s not going to work,” Dave said.  “I was really hoping you’d say 3 or 4 months. We absolutely must have MITCIS within 6 months; we can’t tolerate our security exposure any longer than that, at the absolute worst.  You know how serious this problem is, don’t you?  Can you do it in 6 months?”  “I’m not sure,” Chris said honestly.  “I’d have to look at the project more carefully, but I can try to find a way to get it done in 
2.  Warehouse management system  Your management has asked you to extend its current warehouse management system to receive input from RFID tags and readers for high value electronic equipment.  This equipment, such as automated fareboxes, passenger counters, and train control systems, is sold by manufacturers to public transportation operators. There are many models and variations of each item; large numbers of spare items are carried in inventory in your warehouse and shipped overnight to public transit operators when a unit fails.  Some inventory owned by the manufacturers is also kept at public transportation operator facilities for rapid replacement of failed units.  It is very difficult to keep track of this expensive inventory. While all inventory is supposed to be barcode scanned monthly, this is a low priority task for the staff, and many expensive units are lost or otherwise written off.  Also, with poor data on what the inventory levels are, much more inventory is held than needed to support the service levels and repair times promised by the manufacturers.  RFID tags are electronic transponders that can be read automatically by an RFID reader, without human intervention. The RFID-enabled warehouse will read all tags every few minutes, 24 hours per day, to provide continuous data on inventory levels. The warehouse is run by your organization, who acts as a third party logistics provider for 20 manufacturers of these devices. Each public transit operator who is a customer of yours will be required to place all manufacturer-owned inventory in a room also equipped with an RFID reader that, again, will automatically read inventory every few minutes.  RFID technology is somewhat untested in this environment.  The functional needs of the manufacturers, your company and the public transportation operators are not well understood: the inventory levels, ownership, business terms, data flows and overall use of the new system are not well understood, since it will create substantial changes from current practice.  You have been asked by your management to provide a short discussion of the system development/acquisition/customization approach you would take, as follows:  a. What lifecycle model would you use, and why? Also name at least two lifecycle models you would not use, and say why.  Be prepared to discuss this in class.   b. Your management asked how long it would take to prepare a first release of the system.  Briefly describe how you would estimate this time.  Be prepared to discuss this in class.    c. List at least four major risks in this project, and how you lessen them.  Be prepared to discuss this in class.    3MIT OpenCourseWarehttp://ocw.mit.edu

2.  No uncertainty was communicated to the steering committee.  Chris gave a point estimate, and he didn’t state any assumptions on the size of the project, complexity of requirements, etc. 
3.  No discussions of tradeoffs in functions or team size to meet the 6-month date were held.  Chris should have done this as requirements became complex, and even at the start of the project. 
4.  Chris did not communicate the true schedule as the project progressed.  The real estimates were not given, and no proactive information was given before there was a problem. If requirements took twice as long as expected, so would every other part of the project, and this was not addressed. 
5.  The team did not use the spiral model (or other appropriate model such as evolutionary prototyping, etc.).  They used a waterfall, which is inappropriate for rapid development, which this project clearly required. 
6.  The design was not coordinated properly since the pieces did not fit together. This is poor management and possibly poor use of tools. 
7.  Integration was not begun until too late in design and coding.  Leaving the hard parts until the end is a mistake; they won’t integrate properly.    2b.  Outline the key steps in the resource estimation that the team should have used to avoid these errors/problems.  List at least 5 steps; describe each in 1-2 sentences or phrases.  
1. The aircraft parts distributor has a single warehouse in which all the parts in the catalog are stocked. It has a warehouse management system that stores data on all the parts that are in the warehouse. The system provides the quantity on hand and the price of each part. There are about 5,000 parts handled. Most are jet aircraft parts, but because your CEO is a balloon enthusiast, you also carry a selection of balloon parts.  
2. There is a set of freight carriers that the distributor uses to ship the parts to the airlines. There are about 22,000 carriers, though you generally use a much smaller number.  
3. There is a set of customers that buy the parts; these are airlines or individuals. We provide a small amount of test data only. Airlines buy jet aircraft replacement parts; individuals buy balloon replacement parts.  
4. You will need to create a mechanism to take orders, which can consist of multiple parts. The airlines will pay for the orders via credit card or purchase order. Individuals will pay by credit card.  
5. You will need to track the remaining inventory in the warehouse. You may not ship a part that you do not have in stock. You must decide how to handle backorders.   In this homework you will:  
6. Allow customers to place an order:  a. The customer selects a set of parts, and specifies the quantities.  b. The customer or the manufacturer can specify the mode and carrier; decide how you wish to do this; you do not have to compute the freight charges.  c. The system must compute the total cost of the order, including 5% sales tax. It does not have to compute freight charges.  d. The system must accept payment information, either by credit card or purchase order. (You will not actually implement a credit card interface.)  e. Your system will assign a unique order number.  
7. Display and confirmation of past orders. You do not need to indicate order or shipping status.  
8. You should discuss the following awkward issues:  a. What to do with the order if items are out of stock, or if the full quantity ordered b. Must an order be sent in a single shipment, or can it be split among multiple cannot be shipped  shipments?  c. Must a single carrier be used for each order, or can more than one carrier be used? How do you select the carrier(s)?  d. Must a shipment go to a single address?  e. What error handling will you implement? (Hint: minimal, but describe it)   There are several processes you do not need to consider:  • You do not have to support the processes of updating aircraft parts inventory when new shipments are received at your warehouse, or adding/deleting/changing aircraft parts when the items change.  • You do not have to support adding, deleting or changing freight carriers  • You do not need to consider price changes  • You do not need to consider order status.   Explain your decisions briefly so that implementers understand the design principles. Your system just implements one link of the supply chain: distributor to customer.    2C. Data available   The data that is available as your build the system includes:  
1)  Access the home page on the Web site and, from there, be able to browse our catalog, including pricing, which will be public. i.  If we need to offer discounts or not show pricing, that’s in the next ii.  We may show whether items are out of stock in the next release iii.  A customer cannot order balloon and aircraft parts in the same release order. 
2)  Create an account if she wants to order from us: 1  i.  On a Web page, she can enter or update her name, address, contact info, payment info and username/password ii.  Customers cannot delete their account; only we can do that, manually in the database in release 
3)  If the customer has an account, she logs in with a password.   i.  There are no password hints or help in this simple system.  
4)  Customer selects ‘Place New Order’ from customer Web page. This enters the order header info (customer name, address, date, etc.)  i.  Customer cannot edit name, address, etc. on an order. These can only be edited on the customer page displayed after login, and this will update the info on all orders for the customer.  3    
5)  Customer can browse the parts catalog from this Web page and start building an order by clicking on parts and entering quantities. i.  She can choose the aircraft model to search, which will show a table of parts for that aircraft, or she can enter the original part number   4     
6)  If the amount of a part ordered is more than the quantity on hand, show the amount on hand and ask if ok.   allows changes. i.  Tell user to place another order for remaining quantity of parts in a few days (a very simple approach to backorders) ii.  If we can’t ship what was ordered due to error in inventory count, staff will edit the order to reflect what is shipped, and send email manually to the customer or call the customer.  Add comments fields to note this. 
7)  Show the order line items as they are added in Web page.   i.  When customer hits ‘Done’ button, show summary, including sales tax and total price.  We exclude transportation charges in this system. ii.  Summary has a delete or change button next to each line that

Order status   From the customer Web page after she logs in, in addition to a ‘Place order’ link there is an ‘Order status’ link. This will display all orders for this customer, ordered by the date each order was placed.  This is very simple in your system; you don’t need to show order status or shipping status, just the past orders.  Show all order detail: customer name and address, date, mode, carrier, each line item and quantity, sales tax, total cost.  C.  General information reached from Web site home page       
1.  Use case diagram.  Create a diagram for the use cases associated with items B.2 through B.8 from homework 
2. Just draw one use case diagram for all these cases. a.  Create a diagram for items B.2 through B.8 from homework 
3.  Activity diagram. Create an activity diagram showing the process for validating an order. Focus on the issues of choosing a mode and carrier that can serve the customer, and on checking that the quantity is in stock.  Model the logic of what happens if an infeasible choice is made.   
4.  State diagram.  Create a state machine diagram showing the possible states that an order can have. Focus on how you handle back orders, split shipments (one order in two or more shipments), and combined shipments (one shipment with two or more orders).  You do not have to model order states with invalid payment, changes or cancellations.   
5.  Sequence diagram. (Optional-extra credit)  Create a diagram capturing the sequence of messages between the customer, order, order detail (line items), aircraft part (inventory), carrier and other entities, if needed, for your system.  Use the exercise we did in class as an example.  Model: a.  Whether your warehouse has sufficient product quantities to fulfill the order in this diagram b.  Carrier constraints, based on what modes a customer can accept or what modes can handle a given part. (You can’t ship some hazardous parts by air; some very large parts must go by rail; etc.) You should have made some decisions on how to handle all of these issues in questions 1-5 above in homework 
1.  MIDO a.  Create the MIDO table by doing a SELECT DISTINCT column1, column2, … into MIDO from PMAList. Use the client (MSE) for all the steps in this homework; type the SQL into the query window. b.  Set the primary key. In the object explorer (left part of client), expand Tables, then right click on the MIDO table and select  ‘Design’.  In the window, select the attribute(s) to be the primary key, and right click and select ‘Set Primary Key’. You can select more than one attribute; use the shift or control key.  Save the table after setting the primary key. c.  If SQL Server doesn’t let you set the primary key, there are duplicates in your primary key column.  Usually this means that you’ve forgotten the ‘DISTINCT’ keyword.  We give you a SQL query to look for duplicates at the end of this homework to help you discover any errors. d.  (If you prefer, you may write a CREATE TABLE statement that defines the primary and foreign keys, and then write an INSERT statement to load the data. This avoids having to use the client for this.) 
2.  PMAHolder.  a.  Create the PMAHolder table by doing the appropriate SELECT DISTINCT from PMAList.   b.  Set the primary key for this table, and for each table as you build it.  For composite keys, highlight all the attributes and then hit the key icon. 
3.  Manufacturer a.  Create the Manufacturer table by doing the appropriate SELECT DISTINCT from PMAList.   b.  Set the primary key for this table.   2c.  Insert the manufacturer type. McDonnell Douglas is a jet manufacturer; the others are balloon manufacturers.   i.  In the client, right click on Manufacturer table, select  Design, and add the Type attribute to the table (be sure to select an appropriate ‘Data Type’, nvarchar(
4.  OriginalPart a.  Create the OriginalPart table by doing the appropriate SELECT DISTINCT from PMAList.  Set the primary key for this table.  To create a composite key, highlight all of its columns and then hit the key icon. 
5.  ReplacementPart a.  Create the ReplacementPart table by doing the appropriate SELECT DISTINCT from PMAList. b.  Set the primary key for this table. To create a composite key, highlight all of its columns and then hit the key icon. 
6.  ApprovalMeans.  Build this in a similar fashion. 
7.  Create relationships among tables defined so far. a.  Create relationships as you create each table, to make sure that you’ve created the keys and attributes correctly. Create the relationship between MIDO and ReplPart, for example.   Using the client, right-click ReplPart table and  select “Design” Then right-click the MIDO attribute and select ‘Relationships’. Select “Add” button then click on the “…” after Tables and Column Specification; using the dropdown boxes, select the MIDO column as the primary key in the MIDO table to define the foreign key MIDO in ReplPart.  Hit ‘Close’ when done. Remember to save the table after making this modification. b.  See the final step in the homework for how to resolve problems that may occur.  Also, create Diagrams in the client (right click on your database name, choose ’Database Diagrams’, ‘New Database Diagram’, add the tables you want in the diagram, and the diagram will show you all the relationships). Do this frequently as you build the database.  The key symbol is the ‘1’ end of the 1-to-many relationship.  (If you receive an error while trying to create a diagram, do the following: Right-click the AircraftsParts Database > Select “Properties” > Select the “Files” page on the left > for Owner: type your current SQL Server login ID Select “OK”. Then try again to create Diagram) c.  Create relationships for ReplPart and ApprovalMeans, PMAHolder and ReplPart, Mfr and OrigPart, OrigPart and ReplPart here also. These are all the relationships you have among the tables you’ve built so far. The relationship between OrigPart and ReplPart involves a composite foreign key; select both columns in both tables in the relationships wizard. The columns must be in the 3same order in both tables; drag and drop them up or down in ‘Modify’ as needed. d.  See the final step in the homework for how to resolve problems that may occur.  Also, create Diagrams in the client (right click on your database name, choose ’Database Diagrams’, ‘New Database Diagram’, add the tables you want in the diagram, and the diagram will show you all the relationships). Do this frequently as you build the database to make sure you’re building your database to match the data model.  The key symbol is the ‘1’ end of the 1-to-many relationship. 
8.  Create the AircraftModel table.   a.  This may take a little effort. You may SELECT DISTINCT from the Model1, Mfr attributes of the PMAList table into a temporary AircraftTemp table WHERE Model1 is not null.  b.  You will then need to INSERT INTO AircraftTemp SELECT DISTINCT…  from Model2 through Model5, Mfr into the AircraftTemp table. This is 4 separate queries in the simplest approach; you may instead use a SQL UNION if you wish. c.  Last, you will need to SELECT DISTINCT from the AircraftTemp table to get your final AircraftModel table. This has a composite primary key.  d.  Create the relationship from Mfr to AircraftModel. 
9.  Create the ReplPartAircraft table by using SELECT DISTINCT from PMAList.   a.  You will need to do this for Model1 through Model5, using a similar approach to the AircraftModel table above. You will need a WHERE clause to ensure that the model attribute is not null.   The composite primary key in this table has 4 attributes.  Last, create the relationships from this table to others.  You are building the associative table in the many-to-many relationship between aircraft models and replacement parts. 
10. Create the Mode table. Expand the AircraftParts dataset by clicking the ‘+’ > Right-click the ‘Tables’ folder and click ‘New Table…’. In the properties window (at left) modify the table name from the Default to an appropriate name. There are 4 modes (Highway, Rail, Air, Water); you can enter them by hand. These 4 entries must match the names you use in step 
11. Put a primary key on the Carrier table.  No other changes are needed. 
12. Create the CarrierMode table. This is the associative table between Carrier and Mode that lists all the modes a carrier provides. This may take a little effort. a.  First, create 4 attributes in addition to the single Mode attribute in the Carrier table; call them HighwayMode, RailMode, WaterMode and AirMode. b.  Use wildcard matching to convert, for example, ‘1___’ to a ‘Highway’ in HighwayMode. And ‘_1__’ to a ‘Rail’ in RailMode. Etc.  Use the LIKE keyword with the wildcard. 4c.  Now, you have 4 mode columns in the Carrier table, with the mode values in them for the carriers indicating the modes they offer.  d.  You can now create the CarrierMode table. This may also take a little effort. You may SELECT DISTINCT from the HighwayMode attribute of the Carrier table into the CarrierMode table. You will then need to INSERT INTO CarrierMode SELECT DISTINCT…  for RailMode,WaterMode and AirMode into the CarrierMode table. (This is similar to what you did with AircraftModel, for example.) This table has a composite primary key.   You should name the column Mode, not HighwayMode, in this table. e.  Delete the original Mode column if you wish, or keep it to check correctness while you do the homework and delete it at the end. Be sure to specify the composite primary key to the CarrierMode table. 
13. Create the Customer table.  a.  You may use the Airline table given to you, or create a table with your own customers. b.  If you wish to create customer IDs automatically, use: CREATE TABLE Customers (    CustomerID int identity (1, 
14. Create the OrderHeader table.  a.  It will initially contain no data.   b.  Set its primary key. Use the syntax above to create order numbers automatically. c.  Don’t call this table Order, since ‘Order’ is a SQL reserved word, as in ‘ORDER BY’. d.  Create foreign keys (by creating relationships) for the carrier certificate number (carrier primary key) and mode in the OrderHeader table.  e.  You must make the data types and lengths of foreign keys the same as they are in the parent table (or you won’t be able to create the relationships). 
15. Create the OrderDetail table.   a.  It will initially contain no data.   b.  Set its composite primary key.  c.  Set a foreign key for replacement part and PMA holder. d.  Again, make the data types and lengths of foreign keys the same as they are in the parent table. 
16. After you've built all the tables, you need to verify the relationships between them. You should build the relationships as you go, and they should all be present now. a.  Follow the data model from homework 
1.  Set up a connection to your database. Use the database from the homework 5 solutions or your own, as you prefer. 
2.  Use a master page to provide a consistent look and feel.  You may use the one given in lecture; modify the navigation links on the left as needed.  Use the breadcrumb navigation (SiteMapPath) if you wish; it does not handle pages with querystring parameters (lecture 
3.  Create a home page for your site and other pages, consistent with your requirements.  If some pages contain dynamic content obtained from a database, create ‘placeholder’ pages for them containing a brief text description of their function.  You do not need to create more than 10 pages; you can have one static page describe the function of several dynamic pages that you would build in the next steps. 
4.  From each page, a user must be able to navigate, by using hyperlinks, to other pages. Make the navigation logical and easy for the user. Every page does not need to navigate to every other page, but logical navigation steps must be present. 
5.  Create at least the following pages: a.  Descriptions of your company, product lines, contact information, etc. b.  Links to at least two relevant external sites (e.g., aircraft parts industry association, regulatory agency) from a page with background information. c.  Product catalog overview page.   (
6.  You must use XHTML and CSS, not HTML.  You must have at least one internal and one external CSS style sheet. Use at least one class style and one tag style on your site. Please maintain a consistent style for all the pages on your site.   a.  Your master page will have CSS formatting.  Mimic this in the internal and external style sheets you create. In a real Web site, you would just use the master page.  In this homework, we want you to have some practice creating and using style sheets on other pages. 
7.  You must have a few images on your site.  You should use a few XHTML features, such as lists, on your pages. 
8.  Create your Web site on your notebook computer. See the course Web site for 2MIT OpenCourseWarehttp://ocw.mit.edu
1)  Public transport system with fare collection based on cash/tokens or smart cards.   In a system that primarily accepts cash and tokens at gates and fareboxes: a)  Describe how cash and tokens received for payment should be handled securely. b)  What are the major risks to the transit agency? c)  What are the major risks to passengers? d)  What are the risks in getting collected funds to a transit agency bank account?  Core in cash and token systems: Core is the accounting function at bus depots and rail terminals that accepts cash and tokens from fareboxes and turnstiles, counts them, associates them with stations or buses (and staff who collected the cash and tokens).  Internal risks in cash and token systems: Theft by employees, either those collecting the money, the supervisors in the field, or the employees and supervisors at the depots and terminals.  Risks to passengers. Passengers unlikely to be at financial risk in cash transactions; no credit cards, no identity issues.  Transit system is financially at risk from its employees, but the passengers are not.  Risk in funds to bank:  Mechanical systems to empty turnstiles and fareboxes into containers; transportation of containers to counting facility; systems to identify and resolve differences between machine counts and financial system; match against patterns of revenue to detect skimming. Risks are dishonest employees.  In a system that primarily uses smartcards at gates and fareboxes, including ticket machines at stations to vend smartcards: a)  Describe how cash and tokens received for payment should be handled securely. b)  What are the major risks to the transit agency? c)  What are the major risks to passengers? d)  What are the risks in getting collected funds to a transit agency bank account?  Core in smart card systems: Core is the bookkeeping function in headquarters that tracks smartcards sold by machine, Web, and all other sales channels, and matches it to smartcard use at gates and fareboxes.  Internal risks in smartcard systems: Accounting irregularities in headquarters staff who account for sales and move funds between accounts; they have the authority to make adjustments, and that can be abused. White collar vs blue collar risks.  Risks to passengers. Risk of credit card theft or fraud, ability to associate sales with purchaser, and possibility of abusing that information.  The transit system is less at risk financially from its field employees, but customers are financially more at risk from the new system.  1Risk in funds to bank: Electronic systems to transfer funds from credit card-based purchases of smart cards to transit agency accounts; same as other merchants.  If smart card machines at stations accept cash, the same issues hold as for cash system, but for a much smaller fraction of total revenues.  Employee risk is much smaller.  Higher risk is white collar crime, either at transit agency or outside, to manipulate electronic transactions.  Note that moving more transactions to electronic means shifts the risk from blue collar to white collar crime, and it shifts risks from the agency (or supplier) to its customers (or channel partners). It also centralizes the risk at servers and headquarters, where the risk had been distributed over stations and bus depots in a cash system.   2MIT OpenCourseWarehttp://ocw.mit.edu

1.  o  Select the number, date, determine the subtotal and tax based on the order details quantity and price assuming a tax of 7%, the total of the order, the purchase order number, carrier’s certification number and mode from the order header.  o  You will need to use joins and a conditional clause for the customer (Control GridView
2. You will also need to write statements for the update, insert and delete o  Example: UPDATE [Table] SET [column1]=@column1,.. This will take the value entered in the form view (below) and update the table. (Note: the syntax for insert and delete is different) •  FormView 1, associated with SQL 3:  o  Allow edit, delete, new (insert & cancel) 3o  If you have trouble with the IDENTITY property on order numbers, you may allow the customer to enter the order number. Change the table definition in SQL Server Mgt Studio. o  Go to the Events button (lightning bolt) in Properties Window and add the code for item deleted and item inserted, as in the lecture notes. •  SQL 4: Select from order details, and determine the subtotal of the order (price and quantity) where the order number = order number from grid view 
1. Andrews Co. assumes that BBI has a certificate with a public key, and that BBI sends Andrews Co. the public key whenever it changes (which will be infrequent). Step 
2. Andrews Co. and BBI will secure only a subset of transactions. Shipment notification and order status will be sent in the clear (i.e unsecure). Purchase orders and payment information will be secure. All of these transactions use SOAP (HTTP and XML). All have sequential transaction numbers. Step 
3. Secure transactions will go to one IP address, and insecure transactions will go to another IP address. Both Andrews Co. and BBI will set up two IP addresses just for these transactions. Step 
4. Andrews Co. will create a new 56 bit symmetric key periodically during the day, roughly every hour, but it may be less frequent if there are no transactions to be sent. Step 
5. Andrews Co. will send BBI the new symmetric key as the first message of the day, encrypted with BBI’s public key. Step 
6. Any secure transaction between BBI and Andrews Co. will be encrypted with the symmetric key Andrews Co. generates during the day.  a. Write down the protocol for the secure transactions using the notation used in the Anderson book and in class.  For example, X -> Y: {KZ. X, Y}. Use KX for X’s public key, KXY for a symmetric key.  Define any other symbols that you use.   Please use “A” for Andrews Co. and “B” for BBI.  b. List, if possible, 3 attacks you can devise that would break the security of this connection. Describe each briefly and why it would or could succeed. The attacker has not broken into either Andrews Co. or BBI’s servers or clients.  MIT OpenCourseWarehttp://ocw.mit.edu

List, if possible, 3 attacks you can devise that would break the security of this connection. Describe each briefly and why it would or could succeed. The attacker has not broken into either Andrews Co. or BBI’s servers or clients.  Attacker C could spoof (use) Andrew’s IP address and send a different symmetric key to BBI if some time has elapsed since the last one, encrypted with BBI’s public key. C could then send and receive bogus messages.  Attacker C could break the 56 bit key by brute force in seconds or minutes.   Attacker C could spoof (pretend to be) BBI and send a bogus public key to Andrew. When Andrew sends the symmetric key, C can decrypt it with the corresponding private key. C can send the altered symmetric key on to BBI encrypted with BBI’s public key, and BBI will not know. Attacker C then also spoofs Andrew’s IP address to BBI and can decrypt, using the altered symmetric key (that BBI is using) messages from BBI to Andrew. This is a man in the middle attack.   2MIT OpenCourseWarehttp://ocw.mit.edu
1. Create an XML file to represent an original aircraft part and its replacement part.  Name it airPart.xml. This will have several attributes.  The XML must contain: B.  Assignment  i.  Original part number ii.  Manufacturer iii. iv.  Replacement part number v. Part name PMA holder for replacement part  Create a single XML file that contains at least two original aircraft parts, each with a replacement part.

1.  RFID inventory scans  A warehouse scans its inventory with RFID readers that read every item every 15 minutes. There are 100,000 items in inventory.  The sweep takes one minute to complete, so the data is bursty. The data is sent to the data center 3 km away as it is read.

2.  SSL is a public key, certificate-based authentication system.  SSL certificates can be issued by the aircraft parts company or a third party, which is a certificate authority (CA).  The aircraft parts company, if it issued its own certificates, would also use a root CA.  Each of the 11 companies would decide which certificates had which privileges in its ERP system; there is no centralized security administration. 
3.  The tradeoffs between Kerberos and SSL are: a.  Kerberos requires a trusted server; SSL doesn’t (though it requires a certificate authority to issue the certificates) b.  Kerberos has central management of user authentication and authorization; SSL has certificates that identify the principals, but authorization (access to apps) is handled by each ERP. c.  SSL can be used to establish communications between parties who don’t have a shared secret (private key). This isn’t important in this case, since the aircraft parts company and its customers are known to each other. d.  SSL client certificates only identify the client’s email address, which is weak authentication for access that may allow financial transactions.  A Kerberos username and password are controlled more closely by the Kerberos administrator. e.  Both SSL and Kerberos encrypt the session with the ERP. 
4.  Usernames and passwords are probably the least acceptable. a.  For usernames and passwords, it will be necessary for each of the 11 companies to manage their own system.  Requests to add, change or delete a username will have to be handled at all 11 systems.  The same username/password pair will be assigned to a user across all 11 systems. To manage this centrally would require a group that has admin access to all 11 ERPs, which is probably an unnecessary security risk, since these admins would almost certainly have access to the full ERP.    1

Assume that the transportation economics are favorable, that the railroad fiber network can handle your data traffic, and that the telecom cost is half of Qwest’s bid. You would have to get to the railroad network point of presence. Assume a MAN is available in all cities in which you have facilities, and that the MAN costs would be $20,000 per month for all 8 sites and would provide the same bandwidth as the Qwest proposal.  Would you move your data traffic onto the railroad’s private network?  If so, what conditions would you require?  Discuss briefly.  the files to be sent daily is approximately 300 MB.

These classes will have some form of QoS/service level parameter that TACDOH will use to guarantee end-to-end quality of experience for its users. Also, TACDOH will utilize the contracted bandwidth allocation and bursting capability of each class for better capacity planning.   Mandatory Response Format: Word count: Summary not exceeding two pages, outlining provider’s network base Carrier Ethernet service offerings. If you have predefined classes of service, please use a chart below to show the component breakdown for features like delivery, delay, jitter, and availability.   Qwest Response:  Qwest supports four queue CoS capability on customer access loops to allow customers to prioritize their traffic should customer traffic flows ever exceed any local loop limitation during bursty events in their traffic.  CoS is embedded as part of the Qwest iQ Networking® service offer at no additional costs.  For customers, there never are bandwidth limitations applied to the separate traffic classes – customer has 100% use of that port at their discretion.  This eliminates  many bottlenecks or discard-eligible limits traditionally associated with legacy wide area networks.  The CoS transport features of Qwest iQ Networking Enhanced Ethernet Port are not constrained in the network due to our no-congestion backbone design engineering solution.     Copyright © 2006 Qwest.

6)  At the destination Qwest POP, VPLS Provider Edge queues frames based on CoS class and delivers in prioritized sequence to destination UNI/CPE via ELA. 
7)  At the Destination UNI/CPE, Ethernet frames are queued and delivered in prioritized sequence to the customer’s destination office. 
8)  CoS process is identical in reverse direction.  The CoS capability is only applicable on customer access loops to allow customers to prioritize their traffic should customer traffic flows ever exceed any local loop limitation during bursty events in their traffic.  Packets received at the ingress PE receive what one could call premium status, and are guaranteed to be delivered at the egress PE.  The 
1.  VPN a.  What bandwidth is provided over the IPsec VPN DSL links from Green Bay, WI and Chicago IL?  Look up the typical DSL bandwidth in the telecom book. Then look at the bandwidth needed at these sites on page 
2.  Carrier Ethernet 1  topology is more complex than that. VPNs are typically used for small branch offices or employees working remotely; this is not the case here. T3: Expensive and not needed everywhere.  No redundancy. Need to convert from Ethernet to T3 and back, which cost something and must be managed. Carrier Ethernet: Same protocol as LAN, little or no extra hardware expense, no software, little or no administration, flexible b.  Last mile: Qwest provides Ethernet local access via native Ethernet (MAN Carrier Ethernet) or SONET.  Compare the configurability of MAN carrier Ethernet versus SONET: which one can provide more bandwidth options? MAN carrier Ethernet is preferred, for the same reasons as part a above.  Same protocol as LAN, less hardware expense, less management  c.  Does the Qwest VPLS (MPLS) service encrypt your traffic? If not, is this satisfactory? Qwest does not mention encrypting your traffic, and MPLS typically does not.  Your traffic is physically secure since it does not go over the open Internet. You must trust Qwest to deliver your traffic only to your Ethernet ports (and to no one else’s) and you must trust the MPLS protocol and configuration to not allow eavesdropping by others.  d.  Compare the redundancy of the Qwest proposal with your current The current network has redundancy between the 3 headquarters nodes, but not otherwise. The Qwest network has redundancy between all nodes.  The local access link to the Qwest network, if on MAN carrier Ethernet, also has redundancy. Otherwise it may not. network.  
3.   Cost. The Qwest proposal costs $142,000 per month.   a.  What is the cost of your current network, as shown in Figure 1? Typical monthly costs are $45,000 for OC-3, $15,000 for T-3, and $1,000 for 7 Mbps business DSL.    3 OC-3  5 T-3    2 DSL    Total  $135,000 $ 75,000 $ 2,000 $212,000 b.  Does the Qwest proposal offer a cost savings over your current network?  Yes, about $70,000 per month c.  Your CEO asks what network changes can be made, and savings obtained, if video is eliminated.  Provide a brief analysis.  2Video is only 3-10Mbps out of 21-170 Mbps total bandwidth needed, or 1/7 (14%) to 1/17 (6%) of total bandwidth. Its elimination will result in little savings, since such a small increment in bandwidth does not allow the company to reduce the bandwidth at any node or link. There might be isolated cases where bandwidth could be reduced, but the savings would be negligible. 
4.  Metro area network (MAN) a.  Which of your sites, if any, can be connected by a metropolitan area network (MAN)? Assume MANs are available in all the metro areas in which your company has facilities. Briefly explain your answer. If the MAN is feasible and it is inexpensive, briefly explain how the company might use it.  Your Manhasset and New York sites can be on a MAN, and your San Mateo and San Francisco sites can be on a MAN. These pairs are each in the same metro area. Traffic between them can be handled just on the MAN, lowering the demands on the MPLS network, and they can share an access point to the MPLS network.  This is likely to lower your costs. 
5.  Bandwidth a.  How many phone conversations can be carried in 50 Mbps of bandwidth, as the headquarters sites require?  Assume maximum utilization is 70% and that the average bandwidth used in a voice call is 32 kbps. If each call requires 32 kbps, and we have .7 * 50 Mbps, or about 35 Mbps of capacity, we can carry approximately 1,000 calls on the link. b.  In Lotus Notes, how many 1MB documents can be shared (replicated) per minute with 20 Mbps of bandwidth? Assume 70% maximum utilization. A 1 MB document is 8 Mb.  .7 * 20 Mbps yields 14 Mbps of bandwidth, or 60*14 = 840 Mb per minute. We can transfer about 100 documents per minute. 
6.  Bandwidth to external sites a.  Your biggest customer requires you to send all their documents in a single daily batch transmission that must start after 5pm and must be complete by 6pm.  They are currently in Syracuse, NY, adjacent to your facility and connected via a shared LAN, but are moving to Atlanta, GA.  The size of the files to be sent daily is approximately 300 MB.  Describe and briefly discuss at least 3 options you have. 300MB is 2400 Mbit. 2400 Mbit divided by 3600 seconds, yields a data rate of 670 kilobits/second. This is about half a T1 line. Options: 
7.  Two railroads, UP and CSX, offer you the use of their fiber optic networks, which serve all your locations, as an incentive for you to sign a contract with them.  Assume that the transportation economics are favorable, that the railroad fiber network can handle your data traffic, and that the telecom cost is half of Qwest’s bid. You would have to get to the railroad network point of presence. Assume a MAN is available in all cities in which you have facilities, and that the MAN costs would be $20,000 per month for all 8 sites and would provide the same bandwidth as the Qwest proposal.  Would you move your data traffic onto the railroad’s private network?  If so, what conditions would you require?  Discuss briefly. The cost is attractive: $71,000 per month, plus $20,000 in MAN cost, instead of $142,000 per month.  If you access the railroad comm. networks through a MAN, it is easy to change to another network if the need arises.  You would  4want to assure that the service level (availability, uptime, etc.) meets the same standard as Qwest, and that your data will be protected.   B. Review of Development Cycle 1  Take out your homework 2 solutions and revise them to reflect the knowledge gained from doing the first cycle of development.  Don't rewrite the document; just make changes, additions or deletions to reflect what you've learned.  They can be brief; they can refer to homework sets 3-9 as needed.    Please put in revised screen shots from your Web site to replace the initial Web pages in your homework 2 solution.  Also, revise your estimate of the number and complexity of Web pages to implement your requirements.  Hand in the revised requirements narrative document.  Keep it the same length and organization as your original document. Update the user interface, process descriptions, resource estimates, etc.  Change the error bounds on the resource estimates to reflect the later stage of development.    While you would normally include the UML models, data model, sample database and prototype Web application in the revised requirements (and/or design documents), assume that they are available and will be delivered to the management as separate documents, to which you may refer.  Thus, you should assume that homework sets 3-9 are being handed in to the management as well, and that they have been appropriately edited.   Again, revise only homework

1. There can also be capacity limits associated with each link - to set these limits, you need to click on the link. You also need to turn on the ENFORCE LINK CAPACITIES command from the OPTIONS menu; the default is to ignore the link capacities. The link capacities determine the upper limit on production of a specific product in a specific plant. Links also have production and transportation costs associated with them. These can be ignored for this assignment. Note that if all products, plants, or links are going to have the same parameters, the parameters can be changed together by selecting Change all Products from the Model menu. The software allows you to simulate such systems (Simulate in Model menu). The simulation has two possible options, Minimize Lost Demand and Minimize Costs. On each run of the simulation, the software samples a demand for each product and a capacity for each plant (i.e., a random draw from a normal distribution with the given mean standard deviation, truncated to the range specified by the min and max). Then the software solves an optimization problem to determine how best to meet the demand (or minimize costs) with the given plant capacity and the given product-plant configuration, denoted by the links that indicate which plants can produce which products. If Minimize Lost Demand is selected, the objective of the optimization is to maximize the amount of demand that can be met, or equivalently to minimize the shortfall - amount of demand not Copyright 2005 Stephen C. Graves 2 satisfied. If Minimize Costs is selected, the objective is to determine the production so as to minimize total costs (production, transportation, stockout etc.). The software reports the sales, the average shortfall, the average plant utilization, the average total cost and average gross revenue. The individual plant average utilizations are displayed in the plant icons. Individual product shortfalls are displayed in the product icons. The sales, cost and gross revenue numbers are only meaningful if you actually put the relevant costs into the model. The Minimize Lost Demand option does not consider cost so this option can be used without worrying about the various costs. The software also reports what the shortfall would be if you had "total flexibility:" that is, each plant can produce all of the products. Assignment A.  Suppose you have 6 plants each with capacity of 100 and no variability.  Suppose you have 6 products, each with mean demand of 100 and standard deviation of

2.  Dispersion Economies and Supply Chains   Since the 1990s, supply-chain management (SCM) has emerged as a core component in many firms’ business models.  One of the debates concerning the impact of modern logistics on industrial location choice concerns whether modern logistics (i.e., the modern inventory control and supply-chain configuration) consolidate or disperse manufacturing and distribution locations across regions?  In contrast, do increased customer-service levels that require firms to hold inventories and firms’ cost-minimizing objectives lead them to reduce inventories, significantly affecting the location of industrial real estate?  Discuss these two views, explaining what role analysts think supply chains play in the current regional (industrial) economic restructuring?  In current regional (industrial decline)?

These payments are 1,200 million Renminbi in the North and 3,200 million Renminbi in the South.  By 5:00pm on Tuesday, May 5, you are to provide them a four-page (plus technical appendices) double-spaced, typed report explaining the information requested below. Note this report should be written as if you were actually submitting a report to the Development Research Center, with an introduction and conclusion and references; in other words, the information we request below will then be part of the text of the report. Do not just provide the information directly, but present and discuss it systematically.

2) with no blank cells or cells with non-numbers.   First, HIGHLIGHT ALL THE CELLS WHERE THE INVERTED MATRIX IS GOING TO BE CALCULATED INTO, which must be the same size as the matrix that is being inverted (makes sense!).

1.  We will group students into sets of three to five.    Each group will have 15-20 minutes to do the presentation and another 10 minutes for class discussion. In other words, each group will be given 25-30 minutes. Please assign someone in the group to keep time. No more than 2 to 3 people should present, but all people in the group should participate in gathering information and in writing the group paper.    All members of the group will receive one grade. 
2. You should use PowerPoint (or a similar program) in order to produce slides and handouts for the class. Each team is responsible for preparing the handouts from the slides. Please do not cram too much information into each slide—select key points/arguments and use the material on each slide to guide (rather than dominate) your talk. Think in terms of “quality” rather than “quantity.” 
3.  We want you to be analytical, rather than descriptive, for example: What question will you answer?    What are your assumptions? What are your arguments? What evidence can you draw on to support your claims? You are expected to draw on relevant theories of regional growth, development, and planning from the readings for

6. The oral presentations of each team will be held in the last week of class. All members of the class are required to attend the presentations, even if they are not presenting.       - 2 - Problem Set 5 Grading Criteria  We will assign 25 points for each of the following: 
1.  Typos, incomplete sentences, and misspellings.  Please check the paper carefully and make all necessary corrections before submitting it for others to read.  Be aware that word processor spell checking is not always accurate and that a spell-checker obviously will not find places where you have mistyped a word, but the word you have typed is correctly spelled.     
2.   Facts must be stated with substantiation and/or accompanied with a reference.   
3.  Too many footnotes.  Journal and book publishers are trying to get authors to use fewer footnotes, because of the time and expense in processing them. In any case, many of the pieces of information authors include in footnotes are not relevant to the case being presented and just waste the time of the reader or are sufficiently important that they should be included in the main part of the text.  The chief reason for using a footnote is in the case of a critical piece of information that would interrupt the flow of the paragraph but that needs to be stated.  If possible, any footnotes that are included should be typed at the bottom of the page on which they are referenced.  Some publishers insist on putting footnotes as endnotes, but this almost guarantees that few people will take the time to read them. Items in the bibliography (sometimes called References) should not be numbered; list them alphabetically according to the last name of the (first) author.  That name is followed by a comma and the first name of the same author or the initial(s) of the author.  In general, we do not use just initials if first names are provided.  Some (mainly European) publishers do use only initials. If there is more than one author, the practice presently is to write the names of the additional authors with first name first, rather than with last name first, as was the custom until recently.  Some publishers still use the old practice.  For an example of this, see the Strunk and White reference given on the first page.  When an author's name is repeated in the bibliography, write it again rather than inserting a solid line.

1. Use the ground-water elevation at the monitoring wells to construct a rough contour map of hydraulic head in the vicinity of the landfill. Then, use this map to plot the likely flow pathway of a contaminant particle released from the contaminant source as identified above. Will this pathway transport the contaminant particle toward the lake?  Use your map to estimate the average hydraulic gradient along this pathway.  
2.  Use the borehole logs provided to plot a cross section of the stratigraphy of the subsurface between the landfill and the lake. This cross section can just consider conditions along a straight line drawn between MW-9S, CD-5, GZ2-1 and GZ-2-

6. Look at the screened interval for the monitoring wells where the contaminant 1,4-dichlorobenzene has been detected and divide the wells into wells monitoring conditions in the upper aquifer and wells monitoring conditions in the lower aquifer. Use this information to estimate contours of contaminant concentration in both the upper and lower aquifer. Compare these two sets of contours and draw some conclusions about connectivity between the two aquifers. Also, comment on whether or not the locals were right to be concerned about the contamination of their lake. The local DEP representative tells you that source concentration of 1,4-dichlorobenzene is estimated at 35 µg/l. The representative also tells you that Eckenfelder has found out that the hydraulic conductivity of the upper aquifer is 103 ft/day, while its porosity is 
1.  The general regional setting is that there are hills to the north (not shown on the map) and a generally southward drainage to a large river (off the map to the south).  Immediately to the south of the facility is undeveloped land.  To the south of that is a lake with summer cottages.  All of the cottages take their drinking water from private on-site water-supply wells.  The site is located in glacial outwash deposits.  Surficial deposits consist of fine to medium sands.  At a depth of 5 meters below ground surface is the top of a one-meter thick layer of clay that acts as a confining bed, separating the surficial deposits from another sand and gravel aquifer beneath.  The depth to the water table is approximately 2 meters on site.  The land surface is at an elevation of roughly 100 meters above mean sea level.  Several monitoring wells have been installed as part of a preliminary investigation at the facility.  Locations are shown in Figure

The tank is surrounded by a containment dike of circular plan with a diameter of 2 meters.  The TCE is held within the containment dike, but completely infiltrates into the underlying sandy soil.  The geologic profile consists of the following: 3 meters of medium sand overlying a 10-cm layer of weathered clay which in turn overlies a sand and gravel aquifer.  The clay layer is fractured by numerous large linear fractures.  The typical fracture width is 20 micron.  The water table is one meter below ground surface.  Assume a soil porosity of

A quick check of the pile shows that it remains contaminated with organic chemicals.  You cannot remove the drums and debris until you get further into your site cleanup, but you want to cover it for now to prevent rainfall from infiltrating the waste and spreading contaminants to soil and ground water.  You may need to keep it covered for as long as a year or two.  What type of liner material would you specify for covering the pile?

Your construction firm is about to start construction on a former manufacturing site.  Soils are contaminated with a variety of organic chemicals.  Describe the primary pathways by which your construction workers could be exposed to contaminants on the site. You have been hired as a consulting engineer to complete a cleanup of a recent gasoline spill at a gas station.  This is a new station and there have been no previous spills.  The gas station owner has read about Technical Impracticability Waivers and wants you to pursue that option to avoid an expensive site cleanup.  What will you advise your client as to pursuing a TI Waiver for the site? You are designing a new landfill on a hillside site.  You have determined the slope is too steep to ensure that the required flexible membrane liner will not slip down the slope.  Describe two alternative designs that could be considered to reduce the potential for the liner to slip. The Record of Decision for your site calls for ground-water extraction and removal to clean up contaminated ground water.  However, the site soils 1 are silt and yield only small amounts of water to conventional wells.  Suggest a technology that meets the ROD requirement for ground-water extraction under these site conditions. You have just completed a site screening analysis for a new hazardous waste disposal site.  You have used multiple criteria to identify favorable sites in New England, and come up with a few sites, one of which is very favorable.  On further investigation, you have found that this very favorable site violates one your original screening criteria, which is that there should be no usable aquifer under your site.  Your investigations have shown that there is an aquifer beneath your site, but that it is separated from the land surface by a thick layer of marine clay with very low hydraulic conductivity.  Should you now eliminate this site since it violates your original screening criterion?  Why or why not? You run a business buying the rights to methane gas from municipal solid waste landfills and selling it to nearby power generators.  The town of Mitville closed their municipal landfill 20 years ago but recently learned of the potential value in their old landfill.  They have approached you to buy the gas rights to their landfill.  Would this arrangement by beneficial to both you and the town?

3.  What are the characteristics of sodium bentonite that make it highly suitable for use in geosynthetic clay liners?  What causes it to have those properties? Sodium bentonite swells more and holds more water than other clays.  At the microscopic level, the plates tend to be more dispersed than with other clays and the double layer is thicker. Your construction firm is about to start construction on a former manufacturing site.  Soils are contaminated with a variety of organic chemicals.  Describe the primary pathways by which your construction workers could be exposed to contaminants on the site. 1 The primary exposures come from excavation activities.  The primary pathways are incidental ingestion (from dust and dirt on hands), inhalation (of dust and vapors), and dermal adsorption (from dirt on the skin). You have been hired as a consulting engineer to complete a cleanup of a recent gasoline spill at a gas station.  This is a new station and there have been no previous spills.  The gas station owner has read about Technical Impracticability Waivers and wants you to pursue that option to avoid an expensive site cleanup.  What will you advise your client as to pursuing a TI Waiver for the site? The TI Waiver is a very onerous regulatory process and is reserved for particularly difficult sites where attempted remedies have failed.  A gas station is a straightforward cleanup and would qualify for a TI waiver only under extremely unusual circumstances. You are designing a new landfill on a hillside site.  You have determined the slope is too steep to ensure that the required flexible membrane liner will not slip down the slope.  Describe two alternative designs that could be considered to reduce the potential for the liner to slip. An anchor trench.  High-friction liner material (for example, the micro-spike liners shown in lecture). The Record of Decision for your site calls for ground-water extraction and removal to clean up contaminated ground water.  However, the site soils are silt and yield only small amounts of water to conventional wells.  Suggest a technology that meets the ROD requirement for ground-water extraction under these site conditions. Extraction is extraction, so bioremediation and other non-extractive alternatives will not meet the ROD.  Dual-phase extraction is an extraction technology suited for low-permeability soils You have just completed a site screening analysis for a new hazardous waste disposal site.

The  stress  distribution  is  shown  in  Figure  (d).  To  determine  the  moment,  we  ﬁrst need  to  evaluate  the  point  z0  which  divide  the  compression  and  tension.

1.  Falling head permeameter. The system begins at equilibrium. Water is removed from the bottom of the system, causing the manometer head (h) and the column head (H) to fall.

1)  About  three  and  one-half  years  ago,  Rutch’s  Tavern  in  Dock  Hill  New  York  dumped  a  secret chemical into the Neversink River. The name of this chemical cannot be released for legal reasons but it has an intoxicating effect and is not suitable for pregnant women, children, or anyone needing to drive to work  or  operate  heavy  machinery.  Hence  there  is  concern  that  it  may  reach  drinking  wells  near Wanaksink Lake. To help track the chemical plume, 7 monitoring wells were installed approximately 3 and one-half years ago. Head values in these wells have been fairly constant over the past three and one-half  years.  However,  a  recent  increase  in  hurricanes  has  affected  the  hydrology  of  the  region,  and measurements suggest that the head values have changed. Right before the hurricanes, the chemical was been found near its solubility of 100 mg/l in monitoring wells 1-5, but there was no trace of the chemical in wells 6 or

The output will look similar to Figure 3: 
6. Adding Irrigation wells To overcome the food deficit due to increased population over time, people in the area started to grow Boro, a particular type of rice, during the dry season. Cultivation of Boro rice requires irrigation during the dry months, and so, people installed irrigation wells to withdraw water. At the earlier stage, each irrigation well operated at 15 L/s for 12 hours a day for 100 days. Note that, irrigation water is applied only to the rice fields (the areas other than villages, ponds and trees) that will act a source of recharge on the top-most slice. In the meantime, the number of people dependent on each drinking well increased to 10, but the daily per capita consumption remained the same. Run the model with this changed scenario. Remember to check (and do necessary changes) the initial head condition before running the model for the changed scenario. 
7. Pumping harder! As the demand for rice kept increasing, people replaced the old irrigation pumps with two new pumps that can withdraw water at 24 L/s. The operation time of the pumps and irrigation period, however remained the same. As new houses start to build up, there were two new drinking wells (bringing the total number to

One of the wells was turned on and pumped continuously.  Head measurements were taken at the surrounding wells.  Playing around with Darcy’s law, he noticed an “odd” phenomenon:  based on his calculations from the heads of surrounding wells, the amount of water flowing toward the well appeared to increase over time.  Yet the pumping rate at the well was constant.  Explain to the well-driller what was happening.  Draw cross-sections of the potentiometric surface around the well with time. (10pts.)  2(

7)  The figure below shows a cross-section of a homogeneous, isotropic, confined aquifer with a large-capacity pumping well. The figure is not drawn to scale.  The flows in the rivers are measured 5000 m upstream and 5000 m downstream of the well, and the difference between the upstream and downstream flows is due solely to discharge or recharge of this aquifer.  (No flow goes to or from the other sides of the river.)   Prior to pumping, the flow in West River increased by 1 m3/s along the 10,000 m reach, and the flow in East river decreased by 1 m3/s along the  10,000 m reach.  (i.e the flow in and out of the rivers is 10-4 m3/s per meter length of river.)  There is no other discharge or recharge to this aquifer.

Playing around with Darcy’s law, he noticed an “odd” phenomenon:  based on his calculations from the heads of surrounding wells, the amount of water flowing toward the well appeared to increase over time.  Yet the pumping rate at the well was constant.  Explain to the well-driller what was happening.  Draw cross-sections of the potentiometric surface around the well with time. (10pts.) Darcy’s law is a steady state law, and what Zeke is observing is the transient behavior of the potentiometric surface as it responds to pumping. Under transient conditions in a confined aquifer, water is withdrawn from storage through water expansion and aquifer compaction. Storage is the volume of water produced per aquifer volume per head decline. In this situation Zeke is essentially “mining” water or hydraulic head from the aquifer, so one would expect the drawdown to grow with time as water is continually pumped from storage  and not replenished.  2(
5) Draw a cross-section of a subsurface water system (i.e., everything below ground level).  Label the following: water table, phreatic zone, vadose zone, capillary fringe, unconfined aquifer, confined aquifer, potentiometric surface for the confined aquifer, perched water table, and, in the correct location, an artesian (flowing) well.  Draw an arrow in both the top and bottom aquifers showing the direction of flow.  The grocery cart and shape of the land surface are of no importance.

6) A well is injecting water in a confined aquifer with homogenous, isotropic S and T.  This aquifer is bounded on the north side by an impermeable crystalline rock outcrop, and on the east by a lake. These two boundaries meet at approximately right angles as shown below.    (a) Describe how changes in head in this aquifer may be calculated using image wells. Show the position of the image wells. (10 pts.)    Locate the image wells as sown below, and use the principle of superposition to obtain the actual hydraulic head.        Pumping Well Injecting Well No Flow100  mPumping Well Constanthead100  mWell injectingat rate Q  (b) Will the head change at the well be greater or less than it would be if the boundaries did not exist (i.e. if the well were in an infinite aquifer)? (1point)  Why? (9 points)  The head will be lower in the injecting well with the boundaries than without the boundaries. This is seen with the two pumping image wells compared to the one injecting image well. In this situation, the no-flow boundary will act to increase the head at the original injecting well compared to an infinite aquifer. The constant head boundary will act to decrease the head at the original injecting well compared to an infinite aquifer. These two effects do not exactly cancel each other out due to the non-symmetric geometry of the system.    4   (c)  Once the system has reached steady state, the head at the well is 5 m above the head at the constant head boundary.  Draw a flow net with head lines at 1 m intervals, and appropriate flow lines.  Don’t worry about being precise, just try to show the principles features of the system and avoid anything physically impossible. (15 points)   No FlowConstanthead   5(
7)  The figure below shows a cross-section of a homogeneous, isotropic, confined aquifer with a large-capacity pumping well. The figure is not drawn to scale.  The flows in the rivers are measured 5000 m upstream and 5000 m downstream of the well, and the difference between the upstream and downstream flows is due solely to discharge or recharge of this aquifer.  (No flow goes to or from the other sides of the river.)   Prior to pumping, the flow in West River increased by 1 m3/s along the 10,000 m reach, and the flow in East river decreased by 1 m3/s along the  10,000 m reach.  (i.e the flow in and out of the rivers is 10-4 m3/s per meter length of river.)  There is no other discharge or recharge to this aquifer.  The head in the river remains constant over time and along the river.  The aquifer remains confined. The clay of the confining unit, and of the unit beneath the aquifer is completely impermeable.

8) The diagram below shows a confined, homogeneous, and isotropic aquifer beneath a circular island of radius 100 m in a lake.  A pumping well is located in the middle of the island.  Flow is steady state.  In the picture below the hatched circle in the middle is the well, which is fully screened across the entire aquifer.  Flow is horizontal to the well.  The confined aquifer is 8 m thick.  The extraction rate is

A spark plug wire is loose on the engine, making the aircraft a possible source of ignition (thanks to dual ignition, the engine is running fine).

1.  Unicellular organisms have several strategies to acquire Fe when it is low or tied up in non-bioavailable forms, such as strong organic complexes.  One approach is to reduce the Fe(III) complexes at the cell surface, since Fe(II) complexes are weaker and dissociate more readily, enabling the Fe to be taken up by receptors.  Another approach is to produce and excrete a strong chelator, called a siderophores, that complexes Fe in the bulk solution. The Fe-siderophore complex can then be taken up by a specialized transport system in the cell.

3.  A student is studying the oxidation kinetics of Cu(I) in seawater by molecular oxygen in seawater.  He notices that the reaction deviates significantly from pseudofirst order kinetics. He assumes that this is because the reaction is reversible so he adds 10-5 M EDTA to the solution.  The reaction now displays pseudo-first order kinetics, but the initial rate is about 10x faster than in the original solution. a) How did he determine that the reaction was pseudo-first order in the presence of EDTA?  How did he show that it departed from pseudo-first order behavior in the first place?  How could this reaction be reversible? What is the reductant? b) How would EDTA affect the reverse reaction?  Why is the initial rate so much faster?

2) The Charles River Basin is often salinity stratified due to sea water intrusion from the harbor caused by lock operation, leaks at the dam, etc.  Higher salinity near the bottom impedes the vertical exchange of oxygen (and other substances) between the surface and bottom waters, resulting in anoxia and generally poor water quality near the bottom. In order to artificially destratify the basin, several proposals have been developed.  One calls for using a series of small floating pumps located in the deep portions of the basin as suggested in the figure.  Each pump would circulate water from the surface to the bottom, releasing it passively through a single port.  The surface water would rise as a plume, hopefully inducing enough mixing to keep the basin destratified.  Evaluate this proposal in terms of the characteristic time required to “turn over” the basin as a function of the number of pumps and the flow rate per pump.  Assume that the basin has a maximum depth of ten meters, a surface area of

1.  Physical, Chemical and Microbiological Water Quality Characterization of Dugouts  Dugouts (also known locally as dams) are water supply structures that collect rainwater and intermittent stream flow water. They were reputedly built by Peace Corps and other international aid groups, beginning in the 1960s, to supply water in the water-scarce savannah and Sahel environments of Sub-Sahara Africa and elsewhere. Dugouts are a primary drinking water supply source in many Northern Region districts of Ghana. For example, in Savelugu and Tolon Districts, more than 50% of water to households is  5obtained from dugouts. Although originally introduced from outside, these structures have become widely embraced by local people as a readily available water source. Despite their acceptance, there are several dramatic unintended consequences of this intervention. First, dugouts are breeding grounds for the Cyclops that is the vector of guinea worm. Second, they supply water not only for human domestic use but also water for cattle and other animals. Third, their high turbidity makes this source difficult to treat. This project would involve a study of the physical, chemical and microbiological characteristics of these water structures.   
2. GIS Mapping of Unimproved Water Sources including Dugouts and Kosim Filter Dissemination among Communities Using those Sources in Northern Region, Ghana    Several M.Eng and other students working on this project, Jenny VanCalcar, Rachel Peletz, Sophie Johnson, Kelly Doyle and Mathilde Lerminiaux, have collected GPS data and/or created maps of various aspects of water quality and PHW Kosim filter dissemination in the Northern Region of Ghana. This project would entail expansion of the work of mapping improved and unimproved sources of water, including dugouts as well as Kosim filter and other water treatment dissemination efforts. The researcher would be teamed with a local translator and guide who would travel from village to village. This sub-project would potentially entail living under challenging local conditions in traditional villages (sleeping in huts, eating local food, potential exposure to insects, unsanitary food and poor quality drinking water). The researcher electing this project should read the thesis of VanCalcar (http://web.mit.edu/watsan -> Ghana and discuss the capacity to handle the challenges, especially potential health consequences, with the project supervisor. Alternatively, this project could be performed in conjunction with several of the other studies listed below.   DESIGN, TREATMENT, ASSESSMENT  
3. *** PRIORITY PROJECT ***    Performance, Consumer Preference, Proper Use and Sustained Use of the Ceramic Pot (Kosim) filter + Chlorine Disinfection with Aquatabs.  A technically “ideal” household drinking water treatment system would take out turbidity and disinfect. One of the current best household options for achieving this under the environmental conditions of Northern Ghana is the ceramic pot (Kosim) filter combined with the household chlorine product, Aquatabs, by manufactured by Medentech. This project will look at several major aspects of this “ideal” household treatment system for Ghana – its technical performance via water quality testing, consumer preference for either product, both products together or neither product, and product sustainability including proper use and adherence (“sustained use”).     6Two distinctly different demographics will be considered: urban (modern) households and rural (traditional) households. Modern homes in Ghana are typically of concrete or brick construction, have a concrete or other floor and tin or tile roof, and have access to some form of “improved” water supply and adequate sanitation facility. Traditional households are of mud-brick, thatch roofs, with dirt floors. Traditional households often do not have access to an “improved” water supply and, lacking any sanitation facility, practice open defecation.  A randomized study design may be applied to this project, following the guidance of MIT’s Poverty Action Lab.   
4. *** PRIORITY PROJECT *** Comparison of Two Chlorine Products - Aquatabs vs. HTH Calcium Hypochlorite for Application in Ghana  In order to ensure microbiologically safe drinking water, a disinfection process needs to accompany a particle separation process (sedimentation and/or coagulation and/or filtration are the three simplest particle separation options)  In prior research by Master of Engineering (M.Eng) and Harvard School of Public Health (HSPH) Masters students, solar disinfection options which were innovative variations on SODIS (solar disinfection in PET plastic bottles) have been  investigated and dismissed as viable household-scale disinfection approaches on account of challenging local conditions: high turbidity source waters and Harmattan dust storms from November - March and rainy season conditions from June – August both of which are substantially blocking in-coming solar radiation (See Master thesis work of Iman Yazdani and Melinda Foran at: http://web.mit.edu/watsan/meng_ghana.html)   The logical disinfection approach in Northern Ghana that can complement filtration of water, via ceramic filtered water via Pure Home Water’s Kosim filter, the biosand filter, or some other product,  is chlorination. There are two potential products available in Ghana at this time. One is Aquatabs, which utilize the active ingredient sodium dichloroisocyanurate (NaDCC), also known as sodium troclosene and sodium dichloro-s-triazine trione. The other is HTH dry calcium hypochlorite, packaged in granular form, (chlorine content of 68%), manufactured by Arch Chemicals and locally distributed by Dagyeis Co.   This project would entail a comparison of these two products on the basis of performance, cost and appropriate application. Whereas Aquatabs can be applied either at the household scale,  HTH calcium hypochlorite is designed for community-scale applications only. This project could potentially interface with a similar project currently underway in Western Kenya, lead by a team from Harvard and UC-Berkeley.      7
5. Comparison of Indigenous Practices of Sedimentation and Alum Coagulation with Proctor and Gamble’s PuR.  Indigenous practices embody local knowledge regarding methods to improve water quality. The two chief indigenous methods of water treatment observed in Ghana include sedimentation by gravity settling in large clay storage vessels, and alum coagulation on a seasonal basis using a local alum product. This project would entail detailed investigation of the advantages and disadvantages of the local practices versus application of the Proctor & Gamble product, PuR. Performance, proper use, social acceptability and willingness to pay are the key factors of interest in this project.    
6. Design Modification of the Biosand Filter for Treatment of High Turbidity Waters  International Aid is a Christian charity involved in dissemination of an injection-molded plastic biosand filter in Ghana and several other countries. The biosand filter has proved to be efficacious in numerous settings, however, it has not been proven under the challenging conditions of high turbidity waters in Northern Ghana. Slow sand filters, of which biosand filters are a sub-category, are meant to handle turbidities no greater than 50 NTU.  No known data exists on the performance of biosand filters under high turbidity conditions.  Multi-stage filtration is a drinking water treatment process successful in handling high turbidity water. This project could entail one or two parts: an investigation of the performance of the International Aid biosand product under turbid conditions and/or the design, pilot testing and comparison of a variation on the biosand filter that draws design insight from centralized multi-stage filtration systems applied in Peru and elsewhere, but never yet adapted to household scale. The researcher who selects this project will be offered specific guidance and also put in touch with the work of a Geraldo Galvis (
7. Standardizing Training on Proper Operation and Maintenance of the Ceramic Filter  The Potters for Peace type ceramic pot filter, of which Pure Home Water’s locally branded Kosim filter is one example, has expanded its reach into eight countries over the past ten years. Locally manufactured versions can now be found in the following countries: Cambodia, Ecuador, Ghana, India, Nepal, Nicaragua, Thailand, Vietnam  Moreover, early stage pilot manufacturing and dissemination is occurring in the following seven additional countries: Colombia, Dominican Republic, Indonesia,  8Kenya, South Africa, Tanzania, Yemen.   While a manual has been written and while training materials have been freely shared among implementers, to date there has not been any systematic attempt to standardize instruction and training in proper operation and maintenance. This project would begin with a literature review and collection of training materials, proceed with a field survey of the O&M methods used to train users of the Kosim filter and would then determine best practices for ceramic pot filter disseminators. This project would entail extensive contact with ceramic pot filter implementers around the world. It would also involve the development of training materials that would be posted on the MIT water/sanitation and/or the Potters for Peace Web sites.     
8. Monitoring and Evaluation Framework for Household Drinking Water Treatment and Safe Storage Dissemination  This project could interface with the Global Monitoring and Evaluation of Household Drinking Water Treatment and Safe Storage M.Eng.team project. It will propose a monitoring and evaluation (M&E) framework for household drinking water treatment and safe storage (HWTS) in Ghana, and pilot test a set of monitoring and evaluation indicators. It will apply this framework and set of indicators to the Kosim filter, Aquatabs, cloth filter and biosand filter dissemination efforts to date in Ghana. This will be a potential model for other HWTS M&E efforts beyond Ghana, especially those by the World Health Organization’s International Network to Promote Household Drinking Water Treatment and Safe Storage.   
9. Rainwater Harvesting in Northern Region, Ghana   This project would be offered in collaboration with the Rwanda team’s rainwater harvesting project. Northern Ghana is located in a savannah zone, which is a semi-arid area receiving between 900 – 1100 mm/year.  Rainwater harvesting has been promoted in Northern Ghana by the Presbyterian Church, with whom our project has a close working relationship. The exact nature of this rainwater harvesting project is “to be determined.” Background to rainwater harvesting in Ghana in terms of this season’s conditions is as follows:  Ghana experienced poor rainfall from the onset of the rains during June.  In mid July rainfall became very heavy, causing localized flooding in Northern Ghana and throughout West Africa. While precipitation has lately become significantly reduced, there are now concerns of widespread crop failures beginning to emerge from Northern Ghana. This erratic pattern of rainfall clearly has a bearing on the role of rainwater harvesting structures in supplying or supplementing water for domestic and/or agricultural purposes. One potential project would be to survey the households using the newly installed rainwater harvesting systems to find out what role rainwater plays in their water supply usage patterns.      9IMPLEMENTATION   
10. *** PRIORITY PROJECT ***   Consumer Choice of a Wide Range of Household Drinking Water Treatment Systems  This project is a consumer choice study related to perceived comparative value and actual comparative value/cost of various household drinking water treatment and safe storage  options in Ghana.  It will entail a baseline survey of two urban and two rural communities, choices of products offered at various prices and users followed over a six-month period. This project would be conducted with Pure Home Water staff and potentially with others (MIT’s Poverty Action Lab, Sloan G-Lab and/or Harvard Economics Dept). The person selecting this project will be the team engineer, responsible for water quality testing of a range of product choices, which will include a subset of the following:  Disinfection-Only Options •  Aquatabs (household or community scale) •  Dagyeis (Arch Chemicals) calcium hypochlorite (community-scale only) •  Solar disinfection Particle Removal Options •  Sedimentation  •  Alum and/or Natural Polymer Coagulation •  Biosand Filter – International Aid Plastic Version •  Doulton Candle Filter  •  Okay Candle Filter •  Ceramic Pot Filter (Pure Home Water’s Kosim filter) •  Guinea Worm Cloth Filter Combined System (Particle Removal + Disinfection) Options •  PuR •  Bagged water (a.k.a. “sachet water”)  •  Mission Filter  
11. Guinea Worm Cloth Filter Dissemination (G-Lab)  A cloth filter has been disseminated for free to users in Ghana as part of the Guinea Worm Eradication Program (GWEP). Using randomized, controlled methods, this project will investigate the success of this free dissemination model and compare it to the Pure Home Water social enterprise model, in which filters are sold at two different prices, depending on whether the customer is from an urban or rural household. Does free dissemination undermine long-term sustained use, and if so, does charging a price increase a sense of ownership and personal responsibility. It will answer the question – which model – free distribution or a social marketing model (or other?)  - will quickly and effectively reach millions of people in Ghana and throughout West Africa?  10 MANAGEMENT, PERSONNEL, SCHEDULE AND BUDGET         The full proposal should include a breakdown of responsibilities by staff member, including the name of a project manager; schedule for completion including project milestones and progress reports; and details regarding cost, expressed in terms of hours of effort by job classification (staff engineer, project manager).  BASIS FOR SELECTION  Proposals will be evaluated on a competitive basis using the following criteria:  •  Does the proposal address the client’s needs? •  Originality; •  Likelihood of success; •  Cost (expressed in terms of people-hours).

1. "Green Buildings."  The city of Boston has been making striking efforts to promote green building development. Green building development refers to the adoption of green building techniques to increase the efficiency of the usage of energy, water, and materials within the building. These techniques include installing renewable energy systems, such as solar, and geothermal heating and cooling, wind turbines, bio-diesel combined heat and power system, and using of recycled building materials. The city of Boston and the BRA have provided $100,000 in funding for new construction, historic restoration, and building renovation, in order to facilitate the exploration of green technology. They expect that green buildings decrease expenses on energy bills and maintenance cost for building owners and tenants, reduce building impacts on human health, promote worker productivity, and ultimately help to lessen Bostonian’s dependency on imported energy. One task for us might be to analyze and forecast the impacts of green building investment on Boston’s economy. 
2. "Urban Ring."  The New Urban Ring is an MBTA (Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority) public transportation project, which is to provide a circumferential transportation system to link the existing radial subway and transit lines between downtown Boston and its suburban communities. (http://www.theurbanring.com/). The project has three phases: Phase 1 improves bus service in the Urban Ring corridor; Phase 2 would principally consist of bus rapid transit (BRT) service in the corridor; and Phase 3 would add rail rapid transit for a portion of the corridor. The MBTA is currently in Phase 
3. "Immigration."  The rise of foreign-born population in Massachusetts has continued despite the slowed state’s economy since 
4. "Affordable Housing." Affordable housing will be in high demand in Boston. In the 1980’s, the Boston housing stock increased by 11,353 units, but in the 1990’s, only 1,586 additional units were added. Since 1995, housing prices have increased at twice the rate of income growth in the Boston metropolitan area. Many new and old residents find it difficult to stay in neighborhoods where they used to live. Boston is facing a serious mismatch between housing value and household income. The city’s housing authorities plan to encourage new construction with several million dollars of City funds. What would be the impact of such public spending? Who would benefit from the new construction? 
5. "Boston Waterfront Revitalization."  One of the symbols of Boston is the waterfront. Revitalizing the business environment is one of the targets of the development plan of Boston waterfront.

1. 	(28 points) Stormwater detention ponds are intended to serve both to attenuate flood flows by providing temporary water storage and to improve stormwater quality by removing sediment.  The Massachusetts Stormwater Technical Handbook recommends that stormwater detention ponds provide an average of 24 hours detention time.  The guidelines also indicate that ponds can be between 3 and 12 feet (1 and 4 meters) deep. Given these guidelines, what size particle can be entirely removed in: a. 	A 3-foot (1-meter) deep pond?  d = 
2.  What is the impact of the sediment that passes through?  If lots of clay were to get through and coat the landscape with a whitish-gray clay coating, then the pond size is inadequate.  My overall sense is that the guideline is adequate, but marginal. d. 	 Do you think it is realistic for the state to give a single detention-time guideline when the pond depth is variable?  (Phrased another way, do you think the state should provide different detention-time guidelines for 1-meter deep and 4-meter deep ponds.)  Why or why not? First of all, a fourfold difference in pond depth translates into a twofold difference in sediment size removed.  So, the ponds deliver improved performance in terms of removal at the cost of much larger ponds—not a very favorable tradeoff.  Further, this difference is occurring at the small end of the particle size distribution, and presumably translates into relatively little mass.  Finally, the simple guideline makes for simple implementation 1and enforcement.  From these standpoints, one could argue the simple rule makes practical sense. One could instead argue that detention pond performance should be based on actual calculations to ensure the pond design achieves the particular performance goal specified by regulations.  The calculations are not that complicated, an engineer is necessary to design the ponds in the first place, and it is not too much to ask that a design be done, rather than a cookbook solution.  Many states require this sort of approach. My opinion is that this is a close call, but given the relative insensitivity in performance to size, the simple guideline is acceptable. I was not looking for any particular answer for parts c and d – simple a clear, defensible, and well presented argument for your answer. 2
3. 		(28 points) On-site wastewater treatment via a septic tank and disposal to a subsurface leaching field is a common means to manage wastewater in rural and suburban areas.  The technology depends upon the soil to act as a filter to remove bacteria and viruses.  Please answer the following essay questions regarding your expectations of the mechanisms and effectiveness of this filtration technique. a. 	Bacteria and viruses are generally negatively charged.  If the soil below the leaching field is a sandy soil that is fully saturated with water, would you expect the soil to be generally effective or ineffective in removing bacteria and viruses?  Why or why not? In essence, the soil acts as a slow sand filter.  The negatively charged bacteria and viruses will not be readily filtered by the also negatively charged soil particles.  The primary removal mechanism is straining (followed by biodegradation), which will not be very effective against small particles such as bacteria and particularly viruses. Experimental data show that virus removal by soil is generally more effective from regular tap water than from distilled water.  Provide an explanation for this observation. Tap water has some dissolved cations that can attach to the negatively charged bacteria and viruses, creating a diffuse double layer that reduces electrical repulsion and enhances filtration.  Distilled water does not the dissolved ions to create this effect. Studies have shown that the number of fecal bacteria found in the ground water below a newly constructed leaching field is higher after it first starts to be used but then decreases with time until it reaches an approximately steady level.  Provide an explanation for this observation. This is very much like a filter ripening process for a slow sand filter.  The soils beneath the leaching field act as a slow sand filter, except the schmutzdecke is called a “clogging mat”.  It takes a while for the bacterial cultures that biodegrade wastewater to become established, so bacteria travel through more readily during the start-up period before the clogging mat is established. Very coarse sands allow fast infiltration of wastewater and thus enable smaller, less expensive leaching fields to be constructed.  However, many states ban septic systems in very coarse sands.  Provide a technical explanation for why leaching fields would be banned in very coarse sands. The very coarse sands have a couple of drawbacks.  First, they provide less effective physical straining, which is one of the main mechanisms of treatment in a subsurface leaching field.  Second, they allow rapid travel of wastewater to the water table.  Residence time in the subsurface is important in providing time for first-order waste degradation processes to act. b. 	c. 	d. 	Short answer questions (3 points each, 30 points total).  For each of the following indicate if the designated technology is appropriate for the indicated water-quality problem.  Explain why or why not (answer in no more than a few sentences). a.  A 60-micron household filter for cryptosporidium. Not appropriate – This filter would not work in removing 5-um cryptosporidium spores. b.  Ion exchange for waste contaminated by radioactive cesium and strontium. 3 Appropriate – Despite the radioactivity, cesium is cesium and strontium is strontium.  These cations can be effectively removed by ion exchange. c. 	 A strong-base ion exchange resin for nitrate. Appropriate – Strong-base ion exchange resins remove anions like nitrate, so this is appropriate technology. d. 	 Slow sand filtration for highly turbid water. Not appropriate – Slow sand filtration is effective only against relatively low turbidity waters, with less than 10 to 50 NTU. e. 	 Activated carbon for ground water contaminated by BTEX (benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylene) from a gasoline spill. Appropriate – Activated carbon effectively adsorbs organic compounds and is effective for BTEX (although air stripping is usually more cost effective). Appropriate – Addition of lime raises the pH which enhances oxidation and precipitation of iron and manganese. j. 	 Suspended sediment removal in a vigorously mixed fully-mixed tank. Not appropriate – mixing will keep sediment in suspension, preventing removal f. 	 Filtration for taste and odor. Not appropriate – Taste and odor is usually associated with dissolved organic matter which would not be appreciably removed by filtration. g. 	 Lime treatment for hardness of 90 mg/L as CaCO
4. 	(14 points) In designing a sedimentation basin, indicate whether the first stated design characteristic would require a smaller, larger, or same size basin to achieve the same sediment removal as the second stated characteristic.  Give a short (one or two sentences) explanation of your answer. a.  Large particles vs. small particles of the same density with Type I settling. Smaller tank – large particles have higher settling velocity which would allow a higher overflow rate b. 	 A 3-meter deep tank vs. a 5-meter deep tank. Same size tank – removal is a function only of overflow rate, which is unchanged by tank depth c.  Type II vs. Type I settling of influent particles of the same size and density. Smaller tank – Type II settling causes settling velocities to increase as the particles coagulate and form larger particles.  Therefore overall residence time can be less. d.  Mineral (e.g., quartz) particles vs. organic particles of the same size. Smaller tank – mineral particles have a higher density and therefore higher settling velocity e. 	 Particles with a single settling velocity, Vs, vs. particles with a distribution of settling velocities with a mean settling velocity equal to Vs. A smaller tank is needed for the uniform particles.  A tank of the same size would settle particles with a velocity distribution greater than or equal to the mean settling velocity, but only a decreasing fraction of the particles with lesser settling velocities. f. 	 A long, narrow tank vs. a circular center-feed tank. A long narrow tank is more effective in that it reduces short circuiting.  Therefore the long narrow tank can be smaller. g. 	 Average supply water temperature of 20°C vs. 5°C Viscosity and water density, and therefore settling velocity, are temperature dependant, although viscosity varies much more than density.  At 20C, η =

One such design is the under-gravel filter, illustrated schematically below. Activated carbon Aquarium tank Bubbler tube Gravel The filter consists of a plastic plate that covers the floor of the aquarium and creates an open space beneath the gravel for water to flow to the bubbler tube.  Air is pumped into the bottom of the bubbler tube, and the rising air bubbles entrain water and pump the water upwards.  The water bubbles out of the top of the tube, drops into a plastic container filled with activated carbon, and then flows into the aquarium.  The flow of water up and out of the bubbler tube causes water to draw from the main part of the tank into and through the bottom gravel and then along the tank bottom to the bubbler tube.

First, filamentous bacteria have different growth curves than floc-forming bacteria as shown in the figure below. Second, filamentous bacteria use only oxygen as an electron acceptor and cannot use nitrate for that function; floc-forming bacteria can use either oxygen or nitrate as electron acceptors.  Third, filamentous bacteria cannot store polyphosphates or use acetate for growth as can some floc-forming bacteria. Different designs have used one or more of these characteristics to create “selectors” to favor floc-forming bacteria over filamentous bacteria in AST systems.

1. 	(12 points) Fish generate wastewater too!  Aquariums need to be equipped with filters to remove fish wastes and uneaten fish food from the water.

Identify two major treatment functions at work in the aquarium water treatment system and briefly describe how they function. Solution: The major unit processes are: 1 Aerobic biological treatment by biofilms in the gravel.  This would treat the BOD created by fish wastes, uneaten food, dead plants, and (depending on the care the aquarium receives) dead fish. Activated carbon to remove organics and other absorbable chemicals, including ammonia. If plants are in the aquarium, they would uptake nbitrogen and phosphorus. Air stripping would treat volatile organics if present, but they are unlikely to be present.  Unionized ammonia could be stripped.  Without specificity as to what was being stripped, I gave only partial credit for this answer.

4. (8 points) The operations staff at a sewage treatment plant has decided to reduce the SRT of their activated sludge process from 6 days to 3 days by increasing the recycle rate.  The goal is to reduce the oxygen requirement.  You have been called in as an expert to give a qualitative assessment of this plan. 3a. 	 Will the oxygen requirement actually be reduced? b. 	 Will the MLVSS increase, decrease or stay about the same? Will the sludge settling characteristics improve, stay about the c. 	same, or worsen? d. 	 Will the effluent BOD concentration increase, decrease, or stay about the same? Solution: This can be answered at an intuitive level, or mathematically. The intuitive approach would recognize that there is less time for biological growth and reactions.  Thus the bacterial population will be smaller and there will be less biodegradation.  This implies: Less biodegradation implies less oxygen is needed. Less time for growth implies a smaller X value.

Less time for biodegradation implies poorer treatment and a higher A mathematical analysis for parts a, b, and d is attached. Part II – Short-answer Questions  (5 points each, 60 points total)The following are intended to be answerable with a few sentences or a simple sketch.
5. 	From the standpoint of the overall waste treatment process, is a sequencing batch reactor more like a plug-flow reactor or a fully-mixed tank, and why? Solution: A SBR is a series of fully-mixed tanks.  It approximates plug flow in the same way tanks-in-series approximate plug flow. 
6. 	The wastewater treatment plant for a small town is heavy overloaded with respect to both the wastewater flow and the solids load.  The plant consists of headworks, a primary clarifier, an aeration tank, and a secondary clarifier.  Suggest a measure or measures that could be implemented quickly and which would allow the plant to achieve better treatment. Solution: Chemically enhanced primary treatment. 4 
7. 	 What is the difference between an anaerobic reactor and an anoxic reactor? Solution: Anaerobic = essentially zero oxygen, allowing methanogenesis to occur Anoxic = low in oxygen such that nitrate is also used as an electron acceptor. 
8. 	Activated sludge systems are often designed with long, narrow aeration tanks to approximate plug flow within the tank.  An existing AST tank is proposed to be modified by turning the aerators off along a length of the aeration tank.  The operators hope to improve nitrogen removal using this technique.  Do you think this will work?  Why or why not? Solution: This scheme should work.  The one caveat is that SRT may need to be increased to allow nitrification. 
9. 	The concentration of mixed-liquor suspended solids (MLSS) is often taken as the concentration of active biomass (represented by the variable X in the AST modeling equations).  What are at least two shortcomings to the assumption that X = MLSS? Solution: MLSS contains inert SS, dead bacteria (cell debris), protozoa, non-biodegradable organic matter, none of which are active biomass. 
10. 	 At solids retention times of greater than about 8 days, settling of activated sludge becomes more problematic.  Give at least two reasons for this. Solution: Long SRT leads to pin floc, dispersed flox, possibly filamentous bulking. 
11. 	 Why is control of turbidity considered important for disinfection of drinking water? Solution: Control of turbidity is recognized in EPA regulations as a surrogate for control of cryptosporidium and giardia. Turbidity may: Harbor bacteria, allowing bacteria to avoid full exposure to disinfectants. Exert a demand on chlorine or other oxidants, and thus diminish disinfection. 5 
12. 	 One method to control sludge bulking by filamentous bacteria in activated sludge systems is to segregate the floating sludge (“skimmings”) from the secondary clarifier and keep those skimmings from being recycled to the aeration tank as part of the recycled activated sludge.  How does this method reduce potential for sludge bulking? Solution: Return activated sludge acts as a “seed” for bacteria in the aeration tank.  Skimmings will be enriched in filamentous bacteria and would thus seed those undesirable bacteria. 
13. 	 A wastewater sample is being analyzed to determine its BOD content.  The sample is diluted in order to perform the test: 295 mL of distilled water are added to 5 mL of sample to fill the 300 mL BOD bottle.  The bottle has an initial dissolved oxygen concentration of 
14. 	 An engineer has proposed to add coagulants to improve the Type 1 solids removal in the clarification zone of a sludge thickener and thereby increase the overall solids removal.  Is this a good idea?  Why or why not? Solution: Flux theory indicates that the overall solids flux will be controlled at the solids concentration where the overall flux (Cv + Cu) is least.  This is usually at moderate to high C in the thickening zone, not at the low C in the clarification zone.  This strategy is therefore unlikely to increase the overall solids flux. 
15. 	 Short-circuiting is a greater concern in disinfection systems when 
16. 	 An adequate chlorine concentration for disinfection is often achieved prior to the chlorine “breakpoint.”  Why then is the breakpoint concentration used rather than a lesser concentration? Solution: There are several problems. One is that the form of chlorine created before the breakpoint is not as stable. Another is that to get the peak disinfection ability before the breakpoint, you have to be accurate in the amount of chlorine you add: too much can be as bad as too little.  Chlorinating past the breakpoint is much more forgiving: you can shoot for a high concentration and be confident of adequate disinfection. 7

1.  What scaling behavior does an MD scheme have with respect to the total number of particles N, without applying techniques such as neighbor lists or bins, and why?  Provide an example for this scaling behavior with some pseudocode.    Discuss strategies that may provide better scaling.  Are such strategies applicable for Columbic interactions?

Assuming the LJ potential with nearest neighbor interactions, what is the energy difference between these two atomic configurations (left=string, right=bent structure):     The red and black lines indicate an equal distance between atoms corresponding to the equilibrium separation.

1.  MD scales as N2 if methods such as neighbor lists or bins are not used.  The reason are two nested loops during force calculation, to find all neighbors j of each atom i.  Such scaling is a computational disaster for large systems.  Pseudocode: For i from 1 to N: For j from 1 to N, i not equal j <Evaluate force and energy contributions for i-j interactions> Better scaling:  Use of neighbor list, so that one of the loops can be avoided as long as neighbor lists are not updated. For Coulomb interactions the interactions are long-range, so that neighbor lists can not be efficiently be implemented.  The Coulomb interactions decay as 1/r2, whereas LJ interactions decay as 1/r6,  thus much faster.   
2.  There is no difference in the energies for the two configurations shown.  This illustrates the challenge of modeling molecules, where simple pair potential can not be used.

1)   The two main components in professional sports are competition and emotion. The first makes a sport legitimate, while the second makes it exciting for a fan to watch and care about certain teams. Rivalries are created out of continuous play and dominance, where one team is usually the underdog that the fans are waiting to overcome the tougher opposition. Professional wrestling uses both of these components, but is in a class of its own when it comes to athletic competitions. Viewed more as a show than sport, professional wrestling integrates complex storylines to give each match a greater meaning than a mere exhibition match like one would see in boxing, for instance. To run a successful professional wrestling business, the emotion component must be significantly higher than that of other sports. Henry Jenkins III states that “as a consequence, wrestling heightens the emotional experience offered by traditional sports and directs it toward a more specific vision of the social and moral order” (

What effect does this have on the evolvement of the story?What are the mechanisms that draw the viewer into the story (motivationto view other versions/perspectives)?Write up a short text (max. 1 page) and post it to the server.
1. Draw cards off the top of the current stack (the ﬁrst non-empty stack on your path to the Castle)until you draw an item. If you draw any blue cards (stack modiﬁers), follow the directions on the card and discard it (see Stack Modiﬁer Section). The end of the encounter is the ﬁrst item card drawn or the end of the stack. If there are no cards in any of your stacks, you have reached the Castle! Take the Princess card if you are the ﬁrst one there, or end the game if you are second. 
2. Resolve the encounter I. Add all the strength of the monsters. Note that each location has an effect on encounters (Bears in The Forest are more powerful, etc), and that certain encounters pair together to make stronger monsters (a Bear-Shark is worth 4 instead of 2; note that cards must be paired, i.e. a Bear-Shark Bear is only worth 5, since the second Bear has nothing to pair with). Note that for the purposes of goals, monster modiﬁers apply to all monsters in the encounter (one With Laser Beams gives all monsters in the encounter laser beams but only adds one strength total).II. Add all of your Knightʼs strength, which is a sum of your items bonuses and your Valor Points (only count items you currently have equipped that you have previously won in an encounter).III. If the monsters have more combined strength than you do, you lose. Otherwise you win(this means you win ties). 
3. If you won the encounter, take a Valor Point and any item the monsters were protecting (there may not be one if the encounter ended by the end of the stack). If you lost the encounter, discard oneValor Point (never discard your last Valor Point). 
4.  You draw an In Space (
5.  You draw a Bear, a Wrapped in Bacon, and a Pigeon card. You have reached the end of the stack. The encounter has 2 strength because the Bear is in The Forest. You win the battle. You gain a Valor Point because the Wrapped in Bacon bonus cancels out the Pigeon penalty. Flip over the “Encounter a Pigeon Wrapped in Bacon” goal, it is completed. At the end of the training, you have 8 goal points: 2 from each goal you completed and 4 Valor Points. Notes: The ﬁrst card played in a stack during the Wizard's Phase will be the last drawn from that stack during the Knight's Phase. 
1.  Separate  trait,  action,  and  girl  cards  into  their  own  stacks.  Place  each  stack face down in the middle of the table, while leaving room for discard piles next to each stack. 
2. The dealer is chosen by finding out the player who has most recently obtained a girl's phone number. For back-to-back games, the winner of the previous game becomes the dealer. 
3. Place one girl card face up in front of each player. As the game progresses, the girls may change, increase, move, etc., but they must always remain face up and visible to all players. You must always have at least one girl card in front of you. If  circumstances  leave  you  with  no  girl,  immediately  take  another  girl  from  the pile and play it. 
4.  Each  player  also  receives  2  trait  and  2  action  cards,  face  down.  These  cards make  up  the starting  hands.  Each  player  may  look  at  his  hand  at  any  time and organize it as he sees fit. Play: 
5. The dealer goes first. Players take turns going clockwise during gameplay. 
6. At the beginning of each turn, a player draws 1 card from the action pile and 1 card from the trait pile. During a player's turn, he may play up to 1 trait card, and 1 Swagger card. 
7.  During  his  turn,  the  player  has  the  option  of  discarding  any  two  cards  in  his hand and, afterwards, drawing a single card either from the trait pile or the action pile. This action counts as playing a Swagger card and can only be done once per turn. Playable cards: 
8.  Trait  cards  are  always  placed  face  up  in  front  of  a  player.  Traits  are  only considered  in  play  when  placed  in  this  manner,  not  when  they  are  merely  in  a player's hand. 
9. Action cards are made up of Swagger and Burn cards. Swagger  cards  may  only  be  played  on  your  turn,  and  are  placed  into  the action discard pile after use, unless specified otherwise. Burn  cards  may  be  played  at  any  time  during  gameplay,  and  are  also discarded upon use, unless specified otherwise. Winning: 
10.  Your  objective  is  to  win  the  girl  (or  one  of  them,  provided  a  player  has multiple girls) by having all the traits the girl desires in play. If a player achieves this, and none of the other players can stop him, he wins! MIT OpenCourseWarehttp://ocw.mit.eduCMS.608 / CMS.864 Game DesignFall 2010For information about citing these materials or our Terms of Use, visit: http://ocw.mit.edu/terms.
1.  Hackers  should  use  CPU  beans  to  keep  track  of  how much CPU they have.  Extra CPU does not carry over from turn to turn.  At the start of her turn, a hacker piles all her CPU beans onto the Total CPU space. 2 •	 A hacker can spend as much CPU during her turn as she wants, limited only by the total CPU. As a hacker spends CPU, she should move spent CPU beans from the Total CPU space to the Used CPU space to keep track of how much CPU she has left to spend. •	 A hacker can spend CPU to perform the following actions: –	 Research  Exploit:  A  hacker  can  spend  any  number  of  CPU  to  research  an  exploit  for  a  certain piece of software.  She can increase the corresponding research dial a number of steps equal to the amount  of  CPU  she  spends  to  indicate  her  progress.  When  a  hacker  reaches  level  6  of  a  single color,  the hacker has discovered an exploit and computers with the corresponding color become easier  to  rootkit.  If  the  hacker  is  the  only  one  to  have  discovered  this  exploit,  it’s  a  “zero-day” exploit and it’s even easier to rootkit computers of that color until another hacker discovers that exploit. –	 Research Patch:  A hacker can spend any number of CPU to research a patch for a certain piece of software.  When a patch is researched, any hacker with research for that piece of software has to decrease the research counter for that piece of software a number of steps equal to the amount of CPU spent on the patch.  If a player no longer has enough research to exploit the software, that player  no  longer  has  an  exploit  for  the  software.  A  common  strategy  to  prevent  another  player from removing your exploits is to research a piece of software beyond level 6 (the research dials go up to

1. Token Phase: ·  Each player, starting with the active player and moving clockwise, mayplay up to one of their tokens. Once a token is used, it is ﬂipped overand cannot be used again for the rest of the game.·  Competitive advantage: Place this token under a creature. That·  Token types:creature consumes resources before any other creature this turn. Iftwo or more creatures have Competitive Advantage, ties are brokenby normal consumption phase order.·  Famine: Choose any two resources from any single environment.Cover their square with the black squares for the remainder of theturn. These covered resources may not be consumed by anycreature this turn. ·  Relocation: Choose any creature (not necessarily your own) andmove it to any environment. That creature may not be Relocatedagain during this Token Phase. 
2. Migration Phase: ·  Starting with the active player and going clockwise, each player maymove one of their creatures into an environment sharing an edge withthe one it is in. Repeat three times. A creature may only be movedonce in this way in a turn. 
3. Consumption Phase: ·  A creature can only (and must) consume resources if there areresources available in the environment it occupies equal to itsmutations. If a creature cannot consume all the resources it requires,it consumes no resources, dies and is removed from the board.(E.g.: a creature with two green mutations and a single yellowmutation must consume two green resources and a yellow resource tosurvive.)·  Once a resource is consumed, it may not be consumed by any other 2 ·	creature this turn.

1. Escalation Level: The escalation level represents how emotionally charged the conversation is. It may be raised or lowered by playing action cards, or if the GM decides a turn of conversation is particularly emotive. The GM should keep track of the escalation level with some sort of counter which is visible to both players. Here is an example of what the conversation might be like at different escalation levels: 0 and below: The doctor has forced the patient to be quiet, ending the conversation. The game enters the concluding phase as described in the “Ending the Game” section. 1-2: This level of escalation means the patient is probably withdrawn because the doctor has calmed the patient or the doctor is in complete control of the conversation 3-4: This level of escalation means the patient and the doctor are on even ground; neither is likely to give in to demands at this point, but are willing to agree on a joint solution. 5-6: This level of escalation means the patient is very charged up and is displaying his or her emotions. He or she is much more likely to attack or threaten the doctor at this level. 7 and up: The patient has made a move towards attacking the doctor, and the doctor has no hope but to call security; the game enters the concluding phase as described in the “Ending the Game” section. Playing the Game: On each turn, there is a responding Player and a listening Player. The players alternate turns as the responding player and the listening player (starting with the doctor as the responding player). The responding player has the conversation sheet and the listening player has their guess sheet. The responding player randomly selects 3 words from the word deck and chooses 1 of them. The responding player then has 2 minutes to write a response to the current state of the game, which includes the situation, the conversation up to this point, the escalation, and the patient’s personality (in the case that the responding player is the patient). In addition, he or she must use the chosen word in his or her response. The responding player is encouraged to keep the conversation relevant and true to his or her character.  While the responding player is writing, the listening player secretly writes down 5 words on his or her guessing sheet that he or she believes the responding player will use in his or her response (note that these words cannot be from the included unguessable words sheet). After the 2 minutes are up, the responding player reads his or her response aloud. If the listening player matches any of the words in the response, he or she gets to draw an action card out of his or her action card pile. Different tenses of the same word count as one word; if the listening player guessed “talked” and the responding player used “talk”, the listening player gets to draw a card. Note that even if the listening player guessed more than one word, he or she gets to draw only one action card. The GM should keep track of the number of responses completed with some sort of counter which is visible to both players. If the GM decides that an end condition has been met, the game enters the concluding phase as described under “Ending the Game”. Game Master (GM) Rules: The GM’s job is to keep the game flowing smoothly (help shuffle word cards while the players are writing, etc), keep time during response writing, resolve any questions of whether an action card can be validly played, and to act as arbitrator in resolving the conclusion of the scenario. Additionally, the GM has the ability to change the escalation level as appropriate for any particularly emotional or calming responses. The GM’s arbitration is final and cannot be contested by the patient or the doctor. It is the GM’s responsibility to encourage the players to play within the spirit of the game, which means writing responses which respect the context of the scenario and the patient’s background, include all constraint words in responses, and take into account the effects of any action cards. If, in the GM’s opinion, a response fails to meet these criteria, the GM should point this out and award the other player an action card. The GM can and should use action cards as rewards and penalties depending on if players are roleplaying well. Ending the Game: The players stop writing responses when one of the following end conditions is met: ● 12 responses have been written, regardless of how many each individual player made. This results in hospital security automatically arriving and restraining the patient, regardless of the responses up to this point. ● The escalation level is at

1. Instead, the patient should stay on step marker #
1.  Dismiss any writing myths you’ve adopted, such as -- A- You’re born a good writer, or B- Anyone can write well. Or C- Writing clearly and persuasively is easy. Clear, effective writing takes practice and feedback.  Remember, “Engineers who cannot write and speak well wind up working for those who can.” Tutorials are mandatory (2-3 per term), and I’m here to demystify the writing process and help you improve your writing, no matter how well you write when the term begins. 
2.  When you schedule a 20-minute session with me -- please prepared with an outline, some paragraphs or a draft to discuss. Bring a question about what needs strengthening, such as organizing your ideas logically, identifying a thesis for an essay (answer a question you find intriguing) or unpacking overly complex, confusing or vague sentences. Each of our meetings can be for either brainstorming or for editing. 
3.  Our goal in writing is to help you develop a sense of mastery over your writing and expression. Writing is simply a skill, like driving, and there are rules of the road, which become second nature as you practice, giving you confidence. Talking about your writing and ideas increases the complexity AND clarity of your expression. It is not enough to do it via email. TALKING about writing helps you to figure out your strengths and weaknesses. 
4.  On beginning to write:  After reading and some thought…  •  Decide on one question that intrigues you, and that you have some feeling about. What is the answer to that question?   •  That is the nub of your essay, or your thesis – that is, your answer to a research question on a given topic. [Topic >> research question >> thesis or answer to Q.] •  Write notes about 3-4 of your most important points. What evidence supports your observations?  What might your peers want to know about this question? •  Now organize your thoughts and evidence, outlining the points you’ll make in some logical way -- this will change drastically, if you write a good paper and edit it well. •  Write a draft, revise it and revise it a couple more times (not just minor edits).   
5.  While you are writing your first draft, do NOT start editing, or interrupting yourself. Let the ideas, questions, whatever flow FREELY at first. Be kind to yourself. You want to A -- brainstorm first, to get your ideas down, then B – edit and reorganize sections, then C -- READ ALOUD, polish, correct and read it all again & again. Avoid the standard five paragraph formula for essays, or make it meaningful if you do use it. Diane Hendrix, Writing Tutor  1
6.  Effective writing is about making a sound and persuasive argument. An argument means              a) expressing a point of view and understanding of an issue you have studied, b) supporting your point of view with evidence  c) which you interpret for your reader clearly and persuasively.  Have pity on your reader! Anticipate points she/he may not understand, taking care to explain clearly. Then include answers to arguments your reader may have with points you make. 
7.  Generally, in your opening, you want to tell us what you will tell us and how; then tell us, (the body of your paper), using evidence, examples and arguments; and finally, tell us what you told us, why it’s important and what that may lead to (conclusion). Write/revise you OPENING paragraph LAST, since only then will you really know what you’ve done in your essay. 
8.  Once you have your major points, evidence and conclusion nailed down, construct your opening paragraph with a compelling first sentence. Now you are clear what the paper is about and your opening paragraph tells us what your question is, the answer you have decided on, and the reasons you use to support your argument. Support your single idea (only one per paragraph, normally) with examples, visuals, brief quotes or references to events or persons mentioned in the content you’ve studied. Include only details that bear directly on your claim or argument. The engine (power) for this paragraph is your informed conviction and the relevant detail you use to support it. The paragraph should be focused , with no irrelevant details. Two or three vivid or convincing details are better than ten, which can overwhelm. (Less is often more, when explained carefully and clearly.) 
9.  Once you have written at least one strong paragraph, keep going! Then use the best graphs as a model for the others. You’re making a winning team of arguments, as it were. Be sure to open new paragraphs for each new idea; page long graphs suggest you haven’t separated ideas. Develop your paragraphs by comparing and contrasting, applying logical analysis, detailing a process, using chronology, or other methods. Don’t forget to use transitions between ideas. 
10.  For the first assignment, write two pages of paragraphs like the above, double-spaced.  [If the oral medium is easier for you for getting your ideas organized, record yourself on tape, then transcribe and rework your ideas.] Reading your topic sentences for each graph should lead a reader through the argument of your paper, regardless of length. 
11.  Once you have your ideas and arguments formulated, write a complete draft, then another draft, then read it aloud and ask yourself: •  Do I care about the claims that I’m making?  •  Have I stated them clearly, concisely and with vivid detail? •  Are my supporting details on point and as strong as they could be? • Is my central idea interesting (do I have one?), as well as my supporting arguments, taken together? Do they make sense?  Diane Hendrix, Writing Tutor          2  •  (cid:
1.  What does it mean to "technologize a word" (from the book's subtitle)? 
2.  Imagine you are asked to give a tour of MIT to a person in the stage that Ong labels "primary orality". Where would you take them? What aspects of MIT would this individual easily grasp, and what aspects would he or she have difficulty understanding? 
3.  "More than any other single invention, writing has transformed human consciousness." (p. 
1)  Ong, as we saw last week, argues that the great break in the history of "technologizing the word" occurred with the invention of writing. How would Eisenstein rebut this claim? 
2)  According to Eisenstein, what features of print culture explain its "revolutionary" impact? 
3)  Would Clanchy agree with Eisenstein that the introduction of printing technology in Europe ca. 1450 constituted a Revolution?  Why, or why not? 
4)  While appreciative of Eisenstein's work, Anthony Grafton also has important reservations about her thesis. Discuss one or two of these reservations, and state why you do, or do not, agree with him. 
1) Using arguments provided by Spufford, evaluate the readers of early modern English chapbooks.  Are they the same readers Eisenstein imagines for works of classical scholarship, religion, and science?  Is it possible to generalize about the reading practices of English chapbook readers? 
2) Consider English chapbook readers in light of Ong's arguments about orality and literacy. To what extent do traces of orality remain in the texts of the chapbooks? 
3) Are there texts available in print or online today that resemble any of the excerpts that you read from Samuel Pepys' Penny Merriments? Name one or two publishing genres today that you think might be distantly related to the early modern chapbook, and state why you think there are similarities.   
1)  Which criticisms of her “printing revolution” thesis does Eisenstein address in this debate?  How does she respond to her critics? 
2)  In 1998, Adrian Johns published a volume, The Nature of the Book: Print and Knowledge in the Making, which was just as large as Eisenstein’s earlier thesis, and equally provocative and influential.  As you will gather from Eisenstein’s contribution to this debate, Johns confined himself primarily to examples drawn from seventeenth-century English science and bookmaking.  What are Johns’ criticisms of Eisenstein?  How does he differ from the criticisms made by Grafton and Clanchy two decades earlier? 
3)  Who do you think is right: Eisenstein, or Johns?  Why?   
1)  Discuss two or three reasons why scholars today have not yet figured out how to access the information contained in Inkan Khipus. 
2)  What are the main elements of the theories for “reading” khipus put forth by Conklin and Urton? 
3)  Ong argues that writing restructures human consciousness.  Do you think that khipu-making restructured Inkan consciousness in a similar fashion?     
1)  Does Gitelman think the phonograph provoked a communications revolution  comparable to Eisenstein’s printing revolution?  
2)  Does phonograph technology at the end of the nineteenth century make orality more or less dependent on textuality? 
3)  Based on your reading of Gitelman, do you think technology drove culture at the end of the nineteenth century, or vice versa?    
1)  If one is trying to understand the political, social, and cultural dimensions of reading in contemporary America, what are the advantages of studying book clubs?  The disadvantages?  
2)  What motivates women to join reading groups today, according to Long?  Why are women more likely to join reading groups than men?  
3)  Study the web site for Oprah’s Book club. Has Oprah succeeded, through her             media conglomerate’s use of print, television, and the web, in creating a             national version of the localized clubs Long studies in Houston?  Or is Oprah’s            Book Club qualitatively different than the groups Long has researched? Be             prepared to discuss in class specific web pages on the Oprah site in support of            your response. 
1)  Pablo Boczkowski is not a technological determinist, which is to say, in the context of newspapers in print and online in the 1990s, that he does not think the advent of a new technology by itself radically changed newspapers.  What factors, in addition to the introduction of the web, does he consider when explaining the “digitizing of the news?” 
2)  While Boczkowski provides an intriguing view of the journalists and technicians who worked in the newly digitized newspaper environment in the 1990s, he does not consider the users of the news “products” they created.  Do you see this neglect of readers, which runs opposite to the methodolgy used by Elizabeth Long in Book Clubs, as a flaw in the study?  Would Boczkowski’s thesis have changed in any significant way had he consulted users of the sites he studies?   
3)  Analyze one of the three web sites studied in Digitizing the News. Boczkowski was             in the field from 1997 to

1. The Cabinet of Doctor Caligari While I know that the shocking and distorted imagery in the film was  part of the larger movement of German Expressionism, the use in this film seems to have special significance. I say this because the distorted scenery and lighting only appear during the 'story' part of the film, all of which is apparently an invention of the crazed mind of the main character. Therefore, it seems to signify his madness, and in retrospect, might have been a clue, pointing toward the final narrative twist. It's hard to judge Caligari's role as a mastermind, since there are two different Caligari character's in the film. If however, we focus on the 'evil Caligari', it would seem that he is a fair example of a mastermind. He has much academic knowledge, as he has gained the top position at the hospital, and has discovered powerful manipulations of the somnambulists mind. He also is a good salesman it seems, as he is able to pack his tent at the fair. However, he makes several terrible judgments throughout the story. He is exceptionally overconfident about his ability to avoid getting caught. It really doesn't take much cleverness to catch him, despite the fact that he even gets fairly lucky, when the other townsman redirects the suspicion towards him, when attempting murder himself. He seems to take so much joy in terrorizing these people that he misunderstands the risks. He permits his somnambulist to predict the death of the first victim, and then still proceeds to have that man killed. It is a ridiculously overconfident and foolish mistake. So while he is quite knowledgeable, he does not seem very wise. 
2. Dr. Faustus Faustus, as we discussed, also lacks in wisdom, while being full of knowledge. I haven't read any other of Marlowe's plays, so I don't know how complex his characters tend to be, but Faustus seemed like a character of limited range. At all times he was either blustering with sadistic pride and ambition, or else lamenting his past mistakes. He never learns from his mistakes though. He never understands his own patterns. He is no Hamlet, no Macbeth. It only takes simple arguments to win him over to the devil's side. The evil angel simply needs to mention wealth or power and Faustus is instantly won over. The simplicity of the character seems to fit the style of the play though. Faustus isn't supposed to be a realistic and well rounded picture of humanity. He represents one area of our faults: pride and blind desire. The intent of simplicity is clear through the format of the play. It starts out with a traditional Greek Choral opening, already moving toward an older, simpler style. There is usually only one interaction per scene, and there is a steady pattern of switching between trajic and comedic acts. The concepts of good and evil are clearly laid out, with no real gray area. It therefore is more of a rhetorical play than a realist play, teaching a lesson about pride, in the context of the Protestant religion. Courtesy of Zachary Weston.

1.  Introduction Since  soap  operas  peaked  in  popularity  in  the  eighties,  there  has  been  a  steady decline  in  ratings.  While  there  are  many  reasons  and  possibilities  as  to  why  soap operas  have  dramatically  dropped  in  popularity  and  while  many  scholars  attribute soap opera decline in the mid-nineties to the OJ Simpson trial, soap operas ratings took  another  hit  in  the  late  nineties  (Ford,  As  the  World  Turns  in  a  Convergence Culture, 
2.  Soap  Operas Since  their  creation  in  the  1930s  soap  operas  have  captured  the  imaginations  of people of all ages and all walks of life.  People watch soap operas for diverse reasons. Some  like  the  daily  serialized  story  telling;  others  enjoy  the  family  dynamics;  yet other viewers grew up with the characters on an ongoing soap and have developed a strong bond with many of the residents of their favorite soap opera.  Soap operas often have  “an  emphasis  on  family  life,  personal  relationships,  sexual  dramas,  emotional and moral conﬂicts; some coverage of topical issues; set in familiar domestic interiors with only occasional excursions into new locations (Bowles, 
3.  Creation  of  the  WB The WB was created in 1995 as a television network that would run popular syndi­cated television programs from the eighties and early nineties such as Baywatch  and Star Trek.  As time went on, sitcoms were introduced, along with kids programming that  became  known  as  the  Kids  WB.  In  1997,  the  WB  had  its  ﬁrst  original  family drama,  7th  Heaven,  and  its  moderate  success,  the  WB  was  encouraged  to  produce more  original  dramas.  In  March  1997,  Buﬀy  the  Vampire  Slayer  was  introduced, and  the  network  experienced  the  highest  ratings  in  the  WB’s  history  with  a  new crowd tuning in to watch the shows.  With that, the WB started to target the teen market.  In 1998, Dawson’s  Creek  was introduced to the network the WB became a more permanent ﬁxture in the television choices for teens across America. Other  networks,  originally  known  to  have  teen  dramas  such  as  Fox  with  Beverly Hills:  90210  started to feel the pressure of the WB and gradually shifted program­ming to target older audiences, investing heavily in shows like Ally McBeal.  The WB cornered the teen market and, in the following years would create more programs like Roswell, Charmed  and Felicity.  From 2000-2003, the WB added several other shows like Smallville  and Gilmore  Girls  and tried to attract diﬀerent viewers by targeting men  and  expanding  the  age  range  of  its  fan  base.  However,  several  of  the  shows that  premiered  strongly  had  diﬃcult  sophomore  seasons,  and  hit  shows  like  Buﬀy were  dropping  in  ratings.  By  2006,  the  WB  had  experienced  extensive  failures  and decided to merge with UPN, a similar network, to create the CW. The CW combined SOAP  OPERAS  AND  TEEN  DRAMAS 5 the resources from both of the networks to create the most popular line-up to target teen audiences. 
4.  Teen  Dramas To  get  an  accurate  picture  of  teen  dramas,  they  should  be  categorized  into  two types.  The  ﬁrst  type  is  the  supernatural  teen  dramas;  these  shows  were  the  most popular  ones  in  the  late  nineties  and  have  been  a  staple  CW  programming.  These shows often have supernatural elements, whether it was monsters, demons or spells, and  this  supernatural  programming  quickly  captured  the  attention  of  the  teenage demographic.  Shows  like  the  wiccan-themed  Charmed,  Buﬀy  the  Vampire  Slayer, Smallville, and Supernatural are all considered part this group and while each episode contained a certain supernatural element that needed to be destroyed or vanquished, there  would  also  be  more  mundane  drama  surrounding  the  story  like  romantic  in­terests  or  family  disputes.  For  example,  in  each  episode  of  Charmed,  a  show  about three witches with powers, there would be a main plotline where there is always some sort of evil that has to be taken care of by the end of the episode, but there is also personal  drama  surrounding  each  of  the  characters.  Whether  it  is  trying  to  keep their secret powers hidden from the outside world, or dealing with the scary stalker, or dealing with a diﬃcult break-up, these issues surround the main plotline and give the audience an intimate look inside the lives of all the characters. The  second  type  of  teen  drama  is  even  more  similar  to  the  daytime  soap  opera genre.  This type puts teenage characters in diﬃcult situations, and the show depicts them trying to deal and come to terms with these problems.  These show some of the most prevalent problems all teenagers face, from self-identity and ﬁtting in with the crowd  to  dealing  with  family  problems.  Felicity,  One  Tree  Hill,  Everwood,  Gilmore 6 KATHARINE CHU Girls,  and  Gossip  Girls  are  shows  that  use  the  problems  of  everyday  life  like  going to high school and dealing with the stress of being a teenager as their main plotline, instead of having them battle demons and evils symbolizing the diﬃculties of growing up. 
5.  Comparing  Teen  Dramas  to  Soap  Operas When trying to compare teen dramas with soap operas, it is worth noting the most important diﬀerences at the outset.  Soap operas traditionally follow several families with  approximately  40  characters  on  a  show  at  any  one  time.  In  teen  dramas,  the number  is  usually  around  10,  with  the  number  of  main  characters  usually  staying under  
6.  Also,  teen  dramas  have  a  strong  focus  on  the  teenagers;  in  soap  operas, parents and characters in their 20s and 30s are often the focus of most of the drama. Parents in the earliest teen dramas do not have storylines of their own and show up only  to  ground  or  get  into  arguments  with  the  teen  characters.  Parents  and  adults did not even appear in all the episodes of the teen dramas, while soap opera children and  teenagers  are  the  characters  that  are  often  placed  on  the  back  burner  for  the sake of the plot. Another  diﬀerence  between  soap  operas  and  teen  dramas  is  that  teen  dramas  is dedicated to the characters trying to deal with their own self-image and self-identity. For  example,  in  Buﬀy  the  Vampire  Slayer,  Buﬀy  spends  much  of  her  time  ﬁghting demons  and  vampires,  but  she  is  also  trying  to  deal  with  problems  in  her  social life.  As a newcomer to the high school, she is trying to not get in the same type of trouble  she  was  known  for  at  her  last  high  school  while  trying  to  ﬁt  in.  Not  only is  she  trying  to  ﬁnd  a  group  of  friends  that  will  accept  her,  but  she  is  also  trying to come to terms with her fate as the one girl who has the power to keep evil from SOAP  OPERAS  AND  TEEN  DRAMAS 7 taking over the world.  While soap opera characters might be misguided or have some troubles,  the  main  characters  have  a  strong  support  system.  Every  character  has  a best friend they can count on and, because the main characters are incredibly close to each other, and most of them have stopped trying to “ﬁt in or “be cool. In soap operas,  there  might  be a  rich  crowd,  but  usually  there  is not a  distinct in-crowd or an outcast- someone who is socially unaccepted by everyone. In  teen  dramas,  the  struggle  is  often  for  the  outsider  to  gain  the  acceptance  of the  in  crowd.  For  example,  for  the  entire  ﬁrst  season  of  Smallville,  a  drama  about a teenaged Superman, Clark Kent tried to gain acceptance of the in-crowd and win the aﬀections of Lana Lang, the most popular girl in school.  Clark`s father was aware of his abilities, and afraid his son would risk exposure playing football, he prevented him from joining the football team.  Because Clark was unable to play, he was known as the awkward kid that got teased and even was hung as a scarecrow as a high school hazing ritual.  As the ﬁrst season progresses, the most important social development is  when  Lana  realizes  that  she  enjoys  his  company.  They  become  unlikely  friends who are always there for each other. Another  interesting  diﬀerence  between  soap  operas  and  teen  dramas  is  the  way the  two  genres  view  sex.  While  soap  operas  are  known  for  their  sex  and  suﬀering plotlines, they focus more on the relationships that lead to sex and the suﬀering that comes after it, instead of the act of sex itself.  Sex is often a major turning point in soap operas, especially if the character is committing and act of inﬁdelity.  This marks a deﬁnite breaking point in the relationship of two people.  The character would then have to suﬀer the consequences of the aﬀair, like guilt, the end of a relationship, and oftentimes an unwanted pregnancy. 8 KATHARINE CHU In  teen  dramas,  there  is  just  as  much  or  even  more  preoccupation  with  the  sex as the relationships.  Proctor and Gamble,  the only soap company that still creates soap  operas,  originally  took  a  very  active  role  in  the  creation  of  Dawson`s  Creek. However, when they received a script full of references to sex and masturbation, they immediately withdrew support for the show.  While in soap operas, most characters have to deal with the awkwardness and the secrets and poor judgment surrounding sex,  the  obsession  with  the  act  of  sex  itself  is  less  prominent.  In  Gossip  Girl,  a show  about  the  romances  of  teenage  Upper-east  Siders,  one  of  the  major  plotlines is about Blair and her decision to try and ﬁnd the perfect time to lose her virginity to her boyfriend Nate.  In a group of oversexed teenagers, she tries to make her ﬁrst sexual  encounter  with  her  boyfriend  special  and  there  is  a  mention  of  this  in  just about every episode.  Somehow, all of her attempts have been foiled, either because of interruptions or poor timing, but, as she gradually realizes that Nate isnt the right person  for  her,  she  breaks  up  with  him.  In  a  moment  of  weakness,  she  sleeps  with Nates best friend Chuck and has to deal with the social and emotional consequences of her actions.  The ﬁrst half the season deals with Blair deciding on whether or not she  wants  to  lose  her  virginity  to  Nate,  while  the  rest  of  the  season  deals  with  the social consequences of sleeping with Chuck. The most obvious diﬀerences between soap operas and teen dramas are the simi­larities that teen dramas share with other primetime shows.  Teen dramas air once a week, whereas soap operas air ﬁve times a week.  Not only is there a diﬀerence in the production  costs,  there  are  diﬀerences  in  how  stories  are  told,  too.  There  is  much more of a chance for viewers to actually become involved in the lives of the charac­ters  in  soap  operas,  whereas,  in  teen  dramas,  the  audience  only  sees  the  characters SOAP  OPERAS  AND  TEEN  DRAMAS 9 for forty-ﬁve minutes a week for 20 weeks, creating less of a connection between the audience and the characters. Soap  opera  action  also  tends  to  be  slower  than  primetime  shows  where  every minute counts.  In a show like Veronica Mars, a show about a teenage private detec­tive, important turning point, and clues are dropped all the time that are critical to understanding and solving the mystery.  Thus the level of involvement for the audi­ence is extremely high.  Missing a couple of minutes in a teen drama could mean not understanding the entire episode, while missing a couple of minutes of a soap opera would do little or nothing to understanding the situation.  If soap operas demanded the  full  attention  of  viewers,  it  would  be  diﬃcult  for  the  audience  to  fully  devote  5 hours a week for soap opera watching.  Since people are often busy, soap operas have been  designed  for  people  to  be  able  to  multi-task  while  watchting,  and  still  get  a fairly full soap opera experience. Finally, soap operas end on cliﬀhangers every episode and a typically larger cliﬀhanger for the Friday episode to ensure viewers tune in next week, which are more rare prime-time.  Most teem drama episodes manage to have a resolution, even if the main story arc for the season is far from being over.  The main problem in the episode is solved, giving the audience some sense of resolution.  In fact, many dramas have a standard way  of  wrapping  up  each  episode.  In  every  episode  of  Gossip  Girl  the  show  starts with an omnipresent narrator who runs a gossip blog and has unlimited access to the lives of the shoe’s six main characters.  Each episode also ends with the same narrator giving advice and foreshadowing the upcoming diﬃculties for all the characters.  The episodes always end with the same line, “xoxo Gossip Girl. In Felicity, a show about a  college  student  who  turns  down  Stanford  to  follow  a  boy  she  likes  to  New  York University,  each  episode  starts  with  her  narrating  a  story  about  her  life  in  college 10 KATHARINE CHU and recording it on a tape recorder to send to her friend Sarah.  At the end of each episode, Felicity listens to Sarah`s responding tape.  Each one of these examples give the viewers a sense of a resolution, unlike the soap opera. Soap  operas  and  teen  drama  have  subtle  diﬀerences  with  their  storytelling  tech­niques  and  content,  but  each  of  the  diﬀerences  evolved  mostly  because  these  tech­niques are eﬀective for each type of show.  Given the time constraints,  teen dramas cleverly  package  the  drama-ﬁlled  storyline  in  45  minutes  that  forces  the  audience to  pay  constant  attention  to  the  show  to  understand  the  plot.  Soap  operas,  on  the other hand, have more time to tell the story.  Since the action is much slower, creators insert  cliﬀhangers  to  ensure  that  the  viewers  continue  to  watch.  Both  genres  have managed  to  cleverly  package  itself  in  ways  that  would  most  entice  the  viewer  and keep them coming back for more.

2) Give us some historical background to your arrival at MIT: What family stories have you been told which you imagine are significant precursors to your own life story? You can focus on one episode or use a series of incidents. Here again, bring the story “alive” by grounding in the particular.  
3) Write a narrative of the period in which you found your way to MIT. Once again, the more particular and well-observed, i.e. the less general and clichéd,  the better. For instance, try to avoid excessive exclamation—“I was so stressed!” “It was the best day of my life!”—which won’t tell us much about the specific experience.  Note 1: Some of the models we will be reading are quite dramatic. Don’t let this discourage you. Any experience described honestly, clearly, and with attention to the particular will be engaging, whether it involves high drama or not.

Have a copy of the essay 1 assignment sheet in front of you as you review these pieces.                           2  
1.  Do the title and introduction engage you as a reader and set a context for the essay?  Does the writer’s choice of voice seem appropriate to the topic and argument s/he is making? If not, what suggestions would you make? Does the writer provide a context for understanding the importance of the topic?  
2.  Does the writer adequately compare different viewpoints on an issue? Is each view fairly and equally presented? Does the organization of the comparative analysis work well?  (Typically writers choose between two strategies: (a) present one side first, then the other (A/B) or alternate between positions, exploring different aspects of each (A/B/A/B...) Can you make suggestions to improve the organizational structure? Note: a good test of a comparative analysis essay is to see if the piece can adequately educate a motivated reader about different sides of an issue.    
3.  Has the author chosen appropriate secondary sources representing different points of view?  Do the sources seem credible? Has s/he integrated secondary sources well and quoted from those sources appropriately?  (Are quotes too long or too short?) How can s/he could improve in this area? Are there any other secondary sources (or types of sources) that you would suggest? 
4.  (If applicable) Does the writer integrate the interview material from his/her community research well? (If the writer has not yet included the community research, you can discuss this in the workshop.)  
5.  How effective is the conclusion in dynamically closing the piece? Does the writer effectively stimulate reflection about different sides of an issue? Alternately, does the author present her or his view clearly? (Remember that writers can either affirm the importance of considering different viewpoints or take a stance.) 
6.  How can the writer strengthen the draft on the paragraph, sentence or word level? Here you might comment on such issues as paragraph cohesion (are there any paragraphs in which the sentences might be reordered?), word and sentence structure repetition, run-on sentences, and overuse of being verbs and passive verb constructions.  
1.  Do the title and introduction engage you as a reader? Doesthe writer’s choice of voice/tone seem appropriate to the topic?Does the introduction establish a context for the essay? 
1)  WRITE a letter to me introducing yourself to me as a writer: What’s your relationship to writing? What are your hopes (and fears?) for this class? What happened with you and writing in high school (or elsewhere)? Anything else about you & writing you want to tell me? (e.g., is English your second language, writing you’ve done on your own, what you like to read . . .) 1-1½ pages, word processed, single-spaced with space between paragraphs 
2) 	 READ Didion’s “Why I Write,” Updike’s “Why Write?”, and Louis Menand’s “Bad Comma.” Updike is a novelist and short story writer who has also written a considerable amount of literary criticism and essays on general topics, from Ted Williams’ last time at bat to the genesis of Mickey Mouse’s ears; he is one of the major American writers of the second half of the 20th century. “Why Write,” like Didion’s “Why I Write,” was originally a talk. Didion is a highly-regarded novelist and essayist of the late 20th century with an especially distinctive voice. Menand teaches at Harvard and writes literary and cultural criticism for the New Yorker magazine. Select a brief passage—a sentence or two—from one of these three pieces and respond to it. NOTE: I am not asking you to explain the passage but to amplify it, extend it, question it, talk back to it—in short, to think about it in relation to something you know or have experienced. 1 page double-spaced. We will discuss all three pieces in class and will share your written responses in class. 
1) 	 READ Kennedy Fraser’s essay, “The Poet of Everyday Life,”  which is about the painter Johannes Vermeer ; Alice Walker’s essay, “In Seach of Our Mothers’ Gardens,” and Barbara Pollack’s article ”Stitches in Time.” Walker is a popular feminist writer of the second half of the 20th century, perhaps best known for her novel The Color Purple. Fraser formerly wrote for the New Yorker on the world of fashion. 
2)  MARK at least 2 passages in each essay  that strike you as especially good writing. We’ll share these in class; be prepared to say what makes the writing good. Also:  Select one of these 2 essays and WRITE 1 succinct  explaining how you see the writer drawing the reader into the essay—what sort of things does she do? We’ll share them, and I’ll collect them. 
3) 	 BEGIN JOURNALS. We will keep journals on the creative process: your own responses to readings for class, other classes and readings, songs you hear, movies you see, concerts or dance performances you attend—and, especially, what you notice in your own everyday experience—how you or others solve problems; when you feel “blocked”; when you have insights or make sudden leaps in understanding; when you experience “flow.” Journals must total a minimum of 10 entries; each entry should be dated and be between1 solid paragraph and a page or so in length (don’t stop writing at 1 page if you want to write more!). You may also want to include quotes you come across, pictures or cartoons, lists of things you observe—in other words, be creative with your journals. We will occasionally use journals in class, and I will collect them from time to time. NOTE: If you wish, you may write a personal response to Walker’s or Kennedy’s essay as your first journal entry. NOTE: Journals may be small notebooks or you may keep them on loose-leaf paper. They should be finished no later than November 
1)  READ Nathaniel Hawthorne’s short story, “The Artist of the Beautiful” (
2) 	 CONSIDER:  What does Hawthorne seem to be saying about creative process? What is Jung saying about the artistic temperament? Be prepared to discuss, citing passages as evidence of your interpretation. BRING to class three questions for discussion these readings raise for you.  
1) 	 READ the following three pieces on inventive men: •	“The Undiscovered World of Thomas Edison,” by Kathleen McAuliffe. This article, originally published in the Atlantic magazine, describes what historians are learning about Edison’s ways of thinking and working from the massive Edison archive. •	  Malcolm Gladwell’s New Yorker profile of one of the inventors of television, “The Televisionary.” (This piece is a review of two recent biographies of Farnsworth.) Gladwell frequently writes on science and consumer culture topics for the magazine; he also wrote the recent best-seller The Tipping Point. You can download this article from Gladwell’s website:  http://www.gladwell.com Click on New Yorker articles and scroll down till you find it—it’s not too far down: May 27, 
2)  JOURNALS: How are they going? I will collect journals from some of you next class. 
1) 	 What were you trying to achieve with the changes you made as you revised your essay? 
2) 	 What’s the idea in your essay—the spine, the thing that gives it shape and allows it to stand strong as a piece of writing? What do you want readers to take away from your essay? 
3)  What do you like about this essay? What was challenging? 
1)  WRITE a Journal entry in response to the Maya Lin documentary.

1) 	 FINISH READING excerpts from Rollo May’s 1975 book, The Courage To Create. FOR CLASS DISCUSSION: Pay particular attention to terms May uses, especially courage and encounter. What does May mean when he says we have a “passion for form”? It might help you understand May’s ideas if you try applying them to Maya Lin and/or Paul Taylor. 
1) 	 READ two chapters from Jerry Hirschberg’s The Creative Priority: ch. 5, “Stepping Back from the Canvas” and ch. 10, “Synthesis: Informed Intuition.” Hirschberg was for many years a designer with automakers such as GM and Nissan.

1)  WRITE a 1-paragraph summary (also called a précis) of the movie you’re writing about for Essay II. Pack your paragraph with information: not just plot but also mood, themes, and other aspects of the film that seem important to you should be represented in your brief summary. Please note that I’m not asking you to include judgment or evaluation of the movie, nor to link it to a theme or thesis. Just summarize the movie—and in your own words! We’ll work with these in class. 
2)  MAKE an Annotated Bibliography for your six best sources thus far. That is, list the source, as in Book: Smith, Perry. A Short History of Consumer Culture. NY: Utopia Press,

1) and as the figure walks closer to the camera the music grows louder. Finally, as the man (as it is clear by this point) is just about to the camera and the music is more than loud enough to be heard the scene cuts out and the second film begins. So begins the unique 1993 portrayal of the highly celebrated Canadian pianist Glenn Gould titled Thirty-Two Short Films about Glenn Gould, by director François Girard. The disjunctive structure and style of the film reflected Gould’s personality in life. Girard’s film celebrated, honored, and valued the simple fact that Gould was different and through his interpretation of Gould, he tried to install the same feeling into his audience. It should be mentioned that although Girard valued Gould’s eccentric nature, he also made sure to emphasize the impact he made on those around him with his music. But before I speak about the film and the way it portrays Gould, let us first learn a little bit about the man named Glenn Herbert Gould and in the same fashion as the film. 8 Short Biographical Notes about Glenn Herbert Gould Harrington 2

1)  May, Koestler and Boden all offer definitions of creativity. Compare and contrast two or all three—what are their definitions good for? What do they leave out? 
2)  “Language can act as a screen between the thinker and reality. Creativity often starts where language ends, by regressing to preverbal levels, to more fluid and uncommitted forms of mental activity” (Koestler

1)  Which essay of yours do you like best, and why? 
2)  In which essay do you see yourself growing most as a writer? Explain. 
3)  How, if at all, has your approach to writing changed this term? 
4)  Anything else? I will write each of you a letter in response to reading your portfolio and letter, and will include in it your final grade for the term and a brief assessment of your oral presentation. Note: Your portfolios will be available to be picked up outside my office. They will be there till the first week of Spring term and then I’ll toss any that aren’t picked up. 
1)  Write  an  essay  that draws  on  your  own  experience  and  reflects  on  the  pleasures, passions and purposes of owning or shopping. Topics might be: a favorite possession; collecting (cards, toys, books . . .); garage sales; the urge to splurge; family shopping traditions; gift-giving; holiday shopping; travel and shopping; shopping as a pastime; the shopping mall as a cultural space; the frustrations of shopping; shopping in America vs. shopping  in  (Cyprus,  Bangladesh,  Bulgaria--wherever  you  have  lived);  food  shopping; shopping for school or work clothes; or . . . ??? You will want to include anecdotes from your own experience, what you’ve observed, what pleases you, perplexes you, amuses you, troubles you, makes you wonder. . . You may include ideas, comments, phrases, etc., from other writers, friends, classmates, movies or songs, citing them informally (In Adam Gopnik’s words . . ; When William Wordsworth said . . .). Or, 
2)  Write  an  essay  that  responds  to  “Shopping  as  a  Spiritual  Adventure”;  “Rolex”;  or, “The  Winter  Circus.”  Don’t  try  to  respond  to  every  idea  in  your  chosen  essay  (nearly impossible !) but respond to some part of the essay, or the spirit, the main idea of the essay. You may use an epigraph to signal to the reader what you’re responding to; you may or may not choose to quote or paraphrase from the chosen essay. Note: Remember that while this essay grows out of your own experience, it is not a journal entry or simply an expression of your feelings. However you choose to narrate it, you want your essay to be of interest to readers such as your classmates, friends, and instructors.  Just  like  the  essays  we’ve  been  reading,  something  has  to  hold  it  all together, and it has to go somewhere. This essay will be revised once after Workshopping and comments from me, and may be re-revised or polished. Format for Essays: Follow this format for all essays. Serena Student Consumer Culture Essay I/Draft1* Feb. 19, 2002* *Remember to change the Essay no. and draft no. for each new draftThe Title of Your Essay Goes Here Titles are not underlined, in quotes, etc.; you may use boldface if you like. Your essays should be double spaced. Number your pages, by hand if necessary. Margins: 1” top and bottom; 1¼” left and right. Use a type font that is easy to read—no script, italics, all caps, etc.—and a size similar to this. A 5-p. essay means 5-p. double-spaced in type this size. We will use informal citation for Essays I, II and IV and MLA style for Essay III. All drafts must be word-processed or typed. 
1) 	 Format:  Treat  this  as  an  informal  essay.  That  is,  if  you  quote  sources,  work references to them into the text rather than using citations or footnotes. 
2) 	 Tone: Although your purpose is serious, you are not restricted to using a formal tone such as you would typically use in a research paper. Consider the different ways  Brubach  and  Gladwell  approach  their  subjects.  In  other  words,  you  may choose to make your presence in your essay explicit, as they do, or to keep the focus strictly on the material you’re discussing. Similarly, you may use humor if that seems like a good way to engage with your topic, or a more serious tone, as Jean Kilbourne does. 
3) 	 Logic and claims: This kind of assignment carries a temptation to make large claims about the intentions and effects of advertising. Be very careful how you word such claims; do not make claims you cannot support. 
1) 	 Find a topic that interests you, and frame it as a question. You’ll include this question in the introduction of your essay, and it will help shape your discussion. I’ve listed sample topics below in question form. 
2) 	 Research your topic. I expect you to cite a minimum of 6 sources, at least 2 of which must be books or journals (either in print or electronic format). I will ask you for an Annotated Bibliography before the first draft is due, to help you determine whether your sources are appropriate. 
3) 	 Collect information; take notes. Be sure quotes are complete and accurate. We will discuss quoting and paraphrasing in class before the first draft is due. 
4) 	 Write your first draft. In your Introduction, make sure you provide your reader with some context for the question you’re investigating: Why are you interested in this topic? Why might we be interested in it? Organize the body of your essay just as you would any essay—that is, don’t just tell your readers one thing after another, but shape the way you provide information and, perhaps, ask further questions. In your conclusion, try not to close a door—“See what I just proved”—but open a window for further thinking on your topic. After you’ve written the draft, you should have a clear idea of your thesis, which you can then add to your Introduction. 
5) 	 Cite sources in conformity with MLA style within the text and provide a Works Cited at the end. You will also give a short oral presentation based on your project (description to come). Sample topicsTopics for this paper may be drawn from any aspect of consumer culture—economic, psychological, cultural, historical, and so on. Because this is a short paper, you’ll want to investigate a narrowly focused question. A few possibilities: What is the rationale for MIT’s Open Course Ware, and how does it fit with the consumer-oriented economic approach of most higher education in America? When did the move to protect consumers begin, and what forms does it currently take in the U.S.? –e.g., what is the Consumers Union? What is sustainable development? What are students taught about credit and debt in high school? What are the biggest problems with credit card debt among teenagers and young adults? How are products marketed in elementary and/or secondary schools, and what are the implications for education? What resources exist for acquainting immigrant families with the economics of shopping? How are these resources accessed? What kinds of programs for media literacy, specifically regarding awareness of advertising, exist in American high schools (and middle schools)? How widespread are they? How do measures for consumer protection differ in the U.S. and elsewhere? How much money is spent on advertising in the U.S. in a given industry, and how is that cost passed on to consumers? How do psychologists describe differences between men’s and women’s approaches to shopping? What are the implications? What part of the U.S. economy does the entertainment industry account for? How does the need to attract viewers (audiences for ads) affect presentation and coverage of news? How has the model of “consumer culture” affected health care in the U.S.? What is the Fair Trade Movement? What is the Consumer Price Index, and what purpose does it serve? What role do shopping malls play as civic and cultural spaces? What are the psychological effects of advertising on young people? What are the aims and effectiveness of anti-consumerist or anti-globalization movements? Deadlines for Essay III Topic: A day after Class #
1) 	 We need to use language that lets the reader know that we aren’t taking sources at face value: Schor argues, claims, asserts, considers; she assumes, recognizes, agrees, disagrees; or she explains, implies, wonders, wishes. Even words like “says,  “states, “observes” and “remarks” let us know you aren’t simply taking an author’s words as fact, but are aware that they are her or his belief. 
2) 	 When we quote a sentence or more, we generally need to reflect on the quote, to let readers know why we are bringing the quote to their attention: we don’t just drop the quotes onto the page like so many raisins on top of a bun. 
3) 	 We need to integrate quotes into our own sentences smoothly; the quoted material combined with our own language must form a syntactically correct whole. Sometimes we need to delete a word or couple of words, change a verb tense, or add explanatory language. To do this we use ellipsis and brackets. Thus if the logic of our sentence requires “forming” while our source’s language has “form,” we may write “form[ing]; or if our quote refers to “him,”  “it” or “they,” we may need to tell readers what these words refer to: “they [Americans]” and so on. 
4)  Whether we quote or paraphrase, we must always cite sources. III. Mechanics of citation Consult a style guide that gives you MLA style for citing within your text and in a Works Cited page. Pay particular attention to punctuation surrounding in-text citation; how to set off quotes 4 lines or longer; and how to list various types of sources, including articles in anthologies and web sources. Note: Works Cited contains only sources referred to in your paper. It is not annotated. 
1) 	 Format Each of you should turn in a complete set of letters in your portfolio. The letters should be single spaced and should run continuously. At the top of your 1st page should be: Consumer Culture 03 (or 
2) 	 As you revise I think most of you would benefit from worrying less about whether you’re “on point” and letting your interchange be more organic—i.e., really listening and taking cues from each other. This is particularly true in the series that are feeling repetitious. Don’t be afraid to make a new point! And, even though most of you still need to work more with our readings, don’t be afraid to use personal experience. The places where you do use your own experience make the letters come alive. 
1) 	 What’s the main idea in this essay, the thing that drives it, shapes it, holds it together? 
2)  What has changed in this draft? Please be specific 
3) 	 Where do you see yourself growing as a writer in this essay and this revision? 
1) 	 What are the key ideas discussed in these letters? What’s the key idea, the one that provides a thread for readers to follow? 
2)  What do you like about this essay? What was challenging? 
3) 	 Point to a place in the letters where you feel the writing comes alive. Point to a place you feel would benefit from rework. 
1)  In In Defense of Food, Pollan claims that traditional food cultures are the best guides to eating well. Explain what he means by that, and explore/defend/question/challenge this notion. Use as reference points traditional food cultures you’re familiar with; you may also refer to the food culture of your childhood (traditional or otherwise).   
2)  Pollan suggests that we shouldn’t need “experts” to tell us how to eat; in particular, he discusses the roles played by nutritionists and journalists. Explain what P. means, and explore this idea with reference to your own experience and your reading. Your essay should, among other things, get readers thinking about the ways we depend on all kinds of experts.   
3) Pollan claims that in recent decades we (i.e., Westerners and, especially, Americans) have tended to think of food in terms of the nutrients it delivers—what he terms the “nutritional bias.”  What, in Pollan’s view, is wrong with this emphasis? How should we think of food? –what does he think; what do you think? Why?  
4)  Pollan delivers a fair amount of history (including, but not limited to, political history) of American food culture in his book. What’s the value of understanding history in regard to eating habits, attitudes toward food, health, etc. –how does it help us understand/act on the predicament we’re in today? Your essay should represent Pollan’s thinking to readers, and also include your own thinking.  
5)  We are at once “overfed and undernourished,” according to Pollan. He sees the relationships among diet, medicine and health as problematic, particularly the role of the medical establishment. What does P. mean when he says we’ve “medicalized” the issue of diet? Represent Pollan’s thinking to readers, and  critique it. Your essay should get readers thinking about their expectations of the medical establishment—doctors, pharmaceuticals, surgery, insurance…as well as their expectations re: diet.  
6)  Pollan says, “I no longer think that it’s possible to separate our bodily health from the health of the environment from which we eat or the environment in which we eat…” (p. 
7)  According to Pollan, we (Americans, especially) need to put more effort into obtaining and preparing food; we also need to accept that we will have to pay more for food (i.e., real food; good food). Assuming one agrees with his analysis, what challenges do you see in getting Americans to sign on to this agenda? What do you think would be persuasive, to which audiences/demographics? What might get in the way?  
8)  Write a letter to a (real) friend in which you share some of Pollan’s ideas and your thinking about them. Focus on one theme, and develop one idea that you particularly want this friend to take away from your discussion of In Defense of Food.   Further options:  •  Your essay must take its ideas seriously, but the tone and approach are still yours to choose: exploratory or persuasive; straightforward or playful and humorous. •  Your audience is, most generally, high-school and college educated readers. But if you like, you may target a more particular audience—doctors; parents; school food programs; teenagers with eating disorders… Requirements:    • • •  Hints: •  Your essay must develop an argument, i.e., an idea, that is your own—not just be a series of comments, reflections, questions and/or allusions to texts.  It must make substantial and accurate use of  In Defense of Food and at least one other text we’ve read in this class. It must be 5 pages double-spaced (1250 words).  It must follow the format I gave you with the Essay 1 assignment. •  Essays that analyze, discuss, critique and reflect on ideas succeed according to three main principles: (cid:

1)  READ the following brief essays, all from American food writing : an anthology with classic recipes, edited by food writer Molly O'Neill.   [E-reserve] (cid:
2)  WRITE: A food memory. Pick one memory related to food; our readings should have prompted several.  It may be from early childhood, summer camp, training for a sport, the first time you tried to make pancakes, visiting a friend whose mom cooks unfamiliar dishes—or even your first weeks at MIT.  The goal of this exercise is to write the memory—what happened, and how the food is part of it—as vividly as possible. It will help to write the memory as a scene—maybe even in present tense. Include as much sensory detail as you can—sight, sound, smell, and touch as well as taste. You do NOT need to comment, or to try to say why this particular scene came to mind—just write the memory. We will work with these in class. Approx. 250 words—1 page double-spaced.    
1) READ the selection from Ch. 1, “The Invention of Cooking,” from Felipe Fernández-                       Fall 2008/Boiko   Due in class T 9/16                                       Armesto’s Near a Thousand Tables: a History of Food. Fernandez-Armesto is a British historian who wrote this book based on “outtakes” from research he had done for several other books. [E-reserve]      
2) WRITE:  a)  What is the thesis of this part of Fernandez-Armesto’s chapter? Write one ¶ to support your claim that this is the thesis, including references to the text. Note: The thesis may be a sentence quoted from the chapter, or it may be a sentence of your own that expresses Fernandez-Armesto’s main idea. b)  What fact or comment surprised or interested you the most in this reading? Why? Jot it down in 1-2 sentences. I will collect these and we’ll work with them in class.  FOR CLASS DISCUSSION: How would you describe F-A’s purpose and method in this chapter? What are some of the things he does to keep readers’ attention, i.e., some of his rhetorical strategies?  
1)  READ “Table Manners” (p. 131-
2)  WRITE: Select one sentence from this piece and write a response. Pick a passage that echoes your own thoughts, or challenges them, or puzzles you, or delights you—your choice. (Before doing so, make sure you have read the entire piece and understand what the sentence means in context.)  NOTE: By “respond,”  I don’t mean to explain the passage but to amplify it, extend it, question it, talk back to it—in short, to think about it in relation to something you know or have experienced.    (cid:
3) FOR DISCUSSION: What in “Table Manners” surprised and/or interested you? Why? What do you make of Kass’s contention that etiquette and ethics are continuous? What does Kass mean by etiquette, exactly? (cid:
1)  RESPOND via MIT server to your group members’ essays. PLEASE DO THIS NO LATER THAN 5:00 WEDNESDAY, so that Niall, Maddie and Malik can use your comments when they revise for Thursday’s class.  You can: ask questions, say what you’d like to hear more about, comment on writing that seems especially strong, and make suggestions for strengthening the main idea and/or the overall effect of the essay. Approx. 2 paragraphs.  
2)  Before Thursday’s class, read and print out the Revised Essay 1 that Maddie, Niall and Malik will have posted on Class Web site. Come to class prepared to comment and ask questions.  
1) READ: Our two readings for Tuesday’s class are both on the topic of pleasure and eating. The first focuses more on the psychology of individual pleasure, while the second discusses the ways that pleasure can actually become a political principle.                        Fall 2008/Boiko           Due in class T 9/30                 •  “The Pleasure Teacher” by Michelle Stacy (a recent magazine article) [handout].  •  Michael Pollan, “Cruising on the Ark of Taste” [E-Reserve].  FOR CLASS DISCUSSION: Be prepared to discuss what each author means by pleasure and how exactly it works. (Note: Stacey is a reporter; the ideas she’s describing are those of scholar Paul Rozin. So it’s his ideas that we’re interested in.) And: What do you think of these ideas—can you imagine them working in your life and in American society?    
2) REVISE Essay 
1)  What is your main Inquiry Question—the question you expect to shape your research and your paper? You may also list 2-3 subsidiary questions. 
2)  What do you hope to learn by researching your topic? –just a couple of sentences. 
3)  Write 1 concise paragraph stating why this question matters to you.   (This assignment may be handwritten so long as it is completely legible)  Note: Remember that there are lots of links to organizations concerned with food and health, safety, ecoliteracy, justice, etc. on our Class Web site under “Resources”—they may be helpful to you in narrowing down your topic.   
1)  PREPARE FOR DEBATE Meet with your team and prepare your strategy for Thursday’s debate on the thesis of In Defense of Food. You will also have 20 minutes at the beginning of class to huddle and do your final prep.  Here are a few things to keep in mind:               Due in class Th 10/30     •  Make sure you know who’s responsible for covering which portions of the material. •  Remember that each debater can refer to a notecard; plan to have no more than a few cards—otherwise you’ll waste time searching for quotes and facts. •  Knowing your material is fundamental to successful debating, but it’s only the beginning. Perhaps the most challenging thing about debating is to respond in real time to the points made and challenges issued by your opponents—so plan for that. •  Also: while you must respond to opponents, the people you are trying to convinced aren’t your opponents, but the judges. So don’t let yourself get caught up in ad hominem arguments—arguments that go after an individual. •  Remember that conceding points is part of successful debating—simplistic, dogmatic arguments aren’t likely to be successful with educated audiences.   Due Fri. 10/31 4:00 my office, or by agreement with me 
2)  REVISE ESSAY 2   Aim to make your essay an interesting discussion of some of Michael Pollan’s points—a discussion that is framed and driven by your own idea (thesis). Don’t let your main idea simply be one of Pollan’s—instead, help us to understand P. by putting him in a new framework, a new perspective—your own. Think about who you want to read your essay—what is your ideal audience? What effect do you want to have on them? NOTE: If you haven’t already done so, you must add at least one other reading to your discussion.  Include a cover sheet with responses to the following questions, plus your 1st draft, when you hand in your revision:  Name  _______________________________  What has changed in this draft? Please be specific?  What’s the main idea in your essay? Why does it matter?  Whom do you imagine as your ideal audience for this essay?  What do you like about this essay? Essay 2 Draft 2

1.  What strengths do you see in what I've written? 
2.  What seems to you to be my idea or point here? 
3.  What questions remain for you after reading? 
4.  What suggestions do you have for me in thinking about ways to make this better?       It is also appropriate, when time permits, for readers to ask at the end of the workshop for the writer's assessment of how useful our comments have been and what the writer's plans are for continuing to work on the piece.    The format I've outlined here is not fixed by any means, but will change as our focus of attention changes for particular pieces of writing.  For instance, I might ask you during the workshop to think in a particular way about the text we are discussing, or to address particular questions about the text which I think could help every writer in the class or the group in thinking about her or his own work.  Likewise, the writer whose work is being discussed might have specific questions about the piece and so might ask for our response to particular areas or issues regarding the work.   The process of the workshop, then—the specific ways we focus our attention on the texts at hand—will alter to meet our changing needs.  Sometimes the whole class will focus on the work of one writer at a time; at other times you will work together in small groups and I will circulate to offer assistance and guidance.  There are some things that must not change about the workshop, though:   - The atmosphere must always be a safe and supportive one for writers whose work-in-progress is up for discussion; - The workshop must be encouraging at the same time that we strive to develop a serious critique of the work under scrutiny (and remember that a critique does not imply just negative criticism, but is the result of reading with critical insight—including recognizing what works well, how the writer has succeeded in realizing his or her intentions); - The "communal conversation" of the workshop should produce new insights and possibilities for the work under discussion; should, that is, provide the writer an incentive for further engagement with the text and some concrete ideas for how to begin revising; - No one should usurp all the linguistic space in the workshop; everyone should have equal time and opportunity to express her or his responses; The workshop has something to offer you when you serve as a reader too: an opportunity to learn how     At the conclusion of a workshop on something you have written, you as a writer should be more conscious of how a reading audience responds to your work, should feel renewed interest and energy for returning to the piece and engaging further with it, and should have some specific ideas about how to begin the process of revision to achieve your purposes and aspirations for what you are writing.   other writers approach a task, to acquire and practice using a critical vocabulary applicable not only to your own and your classmates' writing but to any text you read, and to hone your skills as a textual critic.     My hopes for our class workshops are that they will be focused, serious, energetic, and productive, and I will try to facilitate them in such a way as to ensure that they are a rich source of learning for everyone.  I count on each of you to help me in that effort.    Cite as: Rebecca Faery. Course materials for 21W.730-5: Writing on Contemporary Issues: Imagining the Future, Fall

1. How  well  do  the  title  and  introduction  engage  you  as  areader? Does the writer’s choice of voice/tone seem appropriateto the topic? How well does the writer establish a context forunderstanding the essay in the introduction? 
1. ASSIGNMENT:  Explore an issue (psychological, social, ethical) through the lens of a past or current experience(s). The individual experience can be yours or that of someone else. As you narrate that experience to your readers, think carefully about your voice as a writer and the ways in which writing voice helps to establish your perspective for readers. In crafting the essay, pay careful attention to your narrative strategies: - choices in narration (varieties of first person, third person, mixed narration); - setting(s) as establishing a context for your essay; -developing character and using dialogue; -(if relevant) working within multiple time frames; -using figurative language (metaphor, simile) when appropriate; – providing a clear sense of the larger meaning of your piece while avoiding didacticism.        In this assignment, you should use at least two secondary sources in the revised version.  As a writer, you can integrate these sources in one or both of these ways: (a)  as support or clarification of your point of view (b)  as counterargument to your perspective. Be sure to cite your sources (use MLA form) and include a bibliography. Your revision cover letter should explain how you chose these sources and how they influenced your thinking.       If you relate to other sources (from the course or your own reading) as “deep background” informing your writing style, approach or perspective, note in your cover letter (first version and/or revision) which readings influenced either your thinking about this topic or your style as a writer. 
1.  Do the title and introduction engage you as a reader and establish a context for the essay? Do the writer’s  form  of  narration  (first  person,  third  person)  and  voice  (e.g.humorous,  angry,  sad)  seem appropriate to the topic? Are there alternate forms of narration (e.g. diary/journal or letter format) that might be more effective?

1.  Cover sheet identifying the organization whose website you have chosen and the audience that you envision.  This sheet should also make clear how your report fits into the structure of the organization’s web site. 
2.  Overview page providing basic information on your topic laid out as you would expect it to be laid out on the web.  Any intended links to other pages should be underlined.  This page plays a key role in motivating your readers to read the additional material that you provide. 
3.  An FAQ page that reflects the concerns and priorities of your intended readers.       
4.  At least two additional pages (“connected” via ostensible links on the overview page) that lead readers deeper into your material.  The precise relationship between these pages will depend upon your topic and your assumptions about your readers. 
5.  Some graphic material (ranging from photographic images to bar graphs, maps, and pie charts). 
6.  Suggestions for additional reading (including other relevant web sites).  All of these readings should be accessible to a motivated individual without specialized knowledge. In the above assignment description, I have used “page” to refer to a web page.  The number of words per page may vary significantly.  Feel free to structure your report in a way that suits your topic and your audience, but don’t settle for a quick summary of your material.  Mine your review article for every bit of information that might seem relevant to a motivated web user. **When you post the first version of your web report,  include a status report for your workshop partners. 
1.  Read the Texts Critically. Reading with a critical eye is an absolute necessity for a good review. Being critical does not mean being negative — rather it means that you are actively looking for both strengths and weaknesses in the article. As you read, ask questions of the writer and make notes.   
2.  Write the Critical Review. Your critical review should have four basic elements: a.  Introduction 
3.  What is your overall focus of the paper (thesis)?  b.  Summary of Content. This should be no more than a brief portion of your paper. 
4.  Consider the intended audience of the article in your analysis, but don’t necessarily explicitly reference this point in the paper.  d.  Conclusion  Paper Topics  Compare two different perspectives on a particular technologically related ethical/social issue.

1) Find an intriguing parallel between two plays we have read, one being the play that you are presenting to the class.  Choose a specific point of comparison.  You might, for example, focus on:        -a scenic parallel, similar treatment of an event or encounter (a wooing  scene, an interrogation, a death scene)  -a dramaturgical device (overhearing; disguise; the use of soliloquy) -a clearly defined issue (an aspect of sexuality; the role of money; a   -a shared pattern of language (imagery, figures of speech, verse forms) -two similar characters, linked by their social position (e.g., Don John and Edmund in King Lear), situation (Hero and Desdemona), or attitude (Edmund and Iago) daughter’s rebellion; the representation of exotic “others”)         This is only a list of suggestions: choose the second play and parallels that interest you.  I encourage you to discuss your ideas with me before you begin writing.   
2) In an essay of 8 pages, focus on what you consider to be the most illuminating or crucial difference between the two treatments.  How and why are these cases different?  Develop a thesis about this contrast, considering how it reflects or contributes to the plays in their entirety.  The difference could be one of tone, artistic method, social comment, or dramatic function.   n.b.: Given that you have selected a clear parallel, you can quickly make the grounds for comparison explicit in your introduction; then move right in to discuss the distinctions.  Be sure you have a thesis about the nature of the difference between your two selections -- a thesis, moreover, that can be adequately developed and supported with textual evidence.  Cite such evidence carefully, including act, scene, and lines in parentheses.  Ideally, your conclusions will be compelling, persuasive, and not immediately obvious.   You may use secondary texts and outside research to help support your position: include full citations for all texts used, and be sure your quotations are accurate and clearly documented as sch.   I appreciate imagination, sensitivity, and wit, in a title as elsewhere; they can coexist peacefully (indeed, they thrive) with argumentation and correct, concise prose.

1. The most important thing you learned in the class There is a difference between following one's one path and serving others. As a king, that difference can create a big personal conflict and thus lead to being a 'bad' king if one tries to live one's one life. The most important thing I learned in class was about the ambiguity of the hero in the story. That was something I had wondered about when reading the story and just took it for granted to Coriolanus was the hero because his name was the title of the play, regardless of the fact that I didn't think he was a likable character. Got some great insight into Volumnia I learned that communication is one of the major tools of a successful leader. The most important thing I learned was that Coriolanus had many selves, and he did a lot of what his mother told him. Coriolanus' themes of relationships and leadership were very unclear to me after my firstreading.  The presentation was helpful to my understanding of these topics.I learned that the relationship between Volumnia and Coriolanus wasn't as simple asit seemed at first sight; it involves different topics of discussion. Also, I learned somethings about politics in Rome.Learned about a lot of outside info—helpful to understanding Much more depth and understanding of play as a wholePlot and main themes, interesting talking pointsI learned that Coriolanus' motives were largely given to him by his mother.I learned that the parents can’t change.It was interesting to think about the motivations of the Roman people.This isn't directly related to the group, but Nicholas helped me understand Coriolanus'reason for exiling.-Our scene work could have been better. However, I think the two scenes we chose were very good at bringing out all (or most) of the play's themes. -Volumnia, instead of attempting to gain power by stopping Coriolanus, may actually have had different motivations, such as love of Rome. -The most important thing I learned in class today was the role that Volumnia played in shaping Coriolanus. -The most important thing that I think I learned while listening to the discussion was that I don't think you can say that there is a definite hero in any of the plays we have read. (Aside form Hero as a name and assuming we decide on the "definition" of a hero). There are some definite villains (like Iago and Don John). 
2. The aspect or area of the play or class that is still "muddy" or unclear to you What exactly the play is about.Just the whole flow of the presentation. It felt very "impulsive" or very jumpy.How individual ideas came together as a wholeI wanted to hear more about his mother.Volumnia's role as a mother v. a patriotI was still unclear about Coriolanus and the conflicts he had. Where they ever really resolved.I'm still not really sure how much of Coriolanus' character wascrafted by his mother, and how much is his own.I was still a little unclear about what point was trying to be made about Coriolanus'mother. I feel like that conversation needed to be pushed further.I still didn’t understand who the main character was, Coriolanus or the mom.Is Volumnia to blame for Coriolanus mistakes?Who is real villain?I was still unclear about Coriolanus and the conflicts he had. Where they ever really resolved.Nothing except character analysis.-The Valeria/Virgilia part is still not clear to me. Maybe it's just not that important of atheme.-I still am unclear as to what Shakespeare's political beliefs are and how these beliefs shaped the play, the characters, and the events of the play. -While the role that Volumnia played was discussed to great length I still feel unclear on all of her role. 
3. What you enjoyed the most about the presentation A lot of audience participationI enjoyed how they really tried to get the audience involved.I enjoyed how the whole class participated in the analysis/debate/talkI really enjoyed the lively discussions.I enjoyed hearing a lot of the debate that was going on in conversation.I liked that the group members themselves contributed multiple ideas to the discussionsand that they actually challenged and responded to the audience.I really enjoyed the discussions, I think I could participate and contribute a little bit.I also liked that they covered a lot of topics that can be seen in the play like the mother-son relationship, the relationship between patricians and plebeians, etc.I enjoyed when the discussion turned into a debate between audience members.  It showsthe class was engaged and interested in the subject matter.Very thorough discussions of topics that were gone overMore input from groupI liked when John asked what made Coriolanus a hero--sticking to his beliefs or compromising.Interesting questions/points brought upBeing a part of the scenework. :)-I think that not focusing on one or two specific themes of the play was very good. Wehad great discussion about numerous themes and idea's.-I enjoyed the discussion about the competing influences of the love of Rome vs. the loveof family for both Coriolanus and Volumnia.-I like the open discussion for everyone to ask question and break into different topics.
4. A helpful suggestion for improvements to the presentation Could have used more scene work, maybe a little bit more lecture, little less Q&A Practice the acting/memorization more :] It also seemed like they were jumping from onetopic to anotherI'm not really sure why you chose to perform the scenes you did.Maybe you could take some time after the performance to speak about thatspecific scene before you start a broader analysis.Particularly at the beginning of class, there seemed to be some confusion on what thepresenters were trying to convey.  If they could open the discussion by presenting a clear idea as they did with their responses, there might be less bewildered silence.I would have liked to see more scenes, it would have helped to see some of the elementsthat were brought up in the discussions.Better memorization of the acting linesI think that everybody needs to involve themselves in the discussion instead of just a fewpeople.A little boring Have more members of the group speak Better explanation of scenes More preparation I feel like the scene performances could have been more interesting. The purpose of performing them is to better demonstrate what the text is trying to communicate, but I felt like they were just reciting what was written without any real character. Also, the talking during presentation could have been more evenly distributed. They depended too much on the audience. It created many awkward silences.

1. The most important thing you learned in the class There is a difference between following one's one path and serving others. As a king, that difference can create a big personal conflict and thus lead to being a 'bad' king if one tries to live one's one life. The most important thing I learned in class was about the ambiguity of the hero in the story. That was something I had wondered about when reading the story and just took it for granted to Coriolanus was the hero because his name was the title of the play, regardless of the fact that I didn't think he was a likable character. Got some great insight into Volumnia I learned that communication is one of the major tools of a successful leader. The most important thing I learned was that Coriolanus had many selves, and he did a lot of what his mother told him. Coriolanus' themes of relationships and leadership were very unclear to me after my firstreading.  The presentation was helpful to my understanding of these topics.I learned that the relationship between Volumnia and Coriolanus wasn't as simple asit seemed at first sight; it involves different topics of discussion. Also, I learned somethings about politics in Rome.Learned about a lot of outside info—helpful to understanding Much more depth and understanding of play as a wholePlot and main themes, interesting talking pointsI learned that Coriolanus' motives were largely given to him by his mother.I learned that the parents can’t change.It was interesting to think about the motivations of the Roman people.This isn't directly related to the group, but Nicholas helped me understand Coriolanus'reason for exiling.-Our scene work could have been better. However, I think the two scenes we chose were very good at bringing out all (or most) of the play's themes. -Volumnia, instead of attempting to gain power by stopping Coriolanus, may actually have had different motivations, such as love of Rome. -The most important thing I learned in class today was the role that Volumnia played in shaping Coriolanus. -The most important thing that I think I learned while listening to the discussion was that I don't think you can say that there is a definite hero in any of the plays we have read. (Aside form Hero as a name and assuming we decide on the "definition" of a hero). There are some definite villains (like Iago and Don John). 
2. The aspect or area of the play or class that is still "muddy" or unclear to you What exactly the play is about.Just the whole flow of the presentation. It felt very "impulsive" or very jumpy.How individual ideas came together as a wholeI wanted to hear more about his mother.Volumnia's role as a mother v. a patriotI was still unclear about Coriolanus and the conflicts he had. Where they ever really resolved.I'm still not really sure how much of Coriolanus' character wascrafted by his mother, and how much is his own.I was still a little unclear about what point was trying to be made about Coriolanus'mother. I feel like that conversation needed to be pushed further.I still didn’t understand who the main character was, Coriolanus or the mom.Is Volumnia to blame for Coriolanus mistakes?Who is real villain?I was still unclear about Coriolanus and the conflicts he had. Where they ever really resolved.Nothing except character analysis.-The Valeria/Virgilia part is still not clear to me. Maybe it's just not that important of atheme.-I still am unclear as to what Shakespeare's political beliefs are and how these beliefs shaped the play, the characters, and the events of the play. -While the role that Volumnia played was discussed to great length I still feel unclear on all of her role. 
3. What you enjoyed the most about the presentation A lot of audience participationI enjoyed how they really tried to get the audience involved.I enjoyed how the whole class participated in the analysis/debate/talkI really enjoyed the lively discussions.I enjoyed hearing a lot of the debate that was going on in conversation.I liked that the group members themselves contributed multiple ideas to the discussionsand that they actually challenged and responded to the audience.I really enjoyed the discussions, I think I could participate and contribute a little bit.I also liked that they covered a lot of topics that can be seen in the play like the mother-son relationship, the relationship between patricians and plebeians, etc.I enjoyed when the discussion turned into a debate between audience members.  It showsthe class was engaged and interested in the subject matter.Very thorough discussions of topics that were gone overMore input from groupI liked when John asked what made Coriolanus a hero--sticking to his beliefs or compromising.Interesting questions/points brought upBeing a part of the scenework. :)-I think that not focusing on one or two specific themes of the play was very good. Wehad great discussion about numerous themes and idea's.-I enjoyed the discussion about the competing influences of the love of Rome vs. the loveof family for both Coriolanus and Volumnia.-I like the open discussion for everyone to ask question and break into different topics.
4. A helpful suggestion for improvements to the presentation Could have used more scene work, maybe a little bit more lecture, little less Q&A Practice the acting/memorization more :] It also seemed like they were jumping from onetopic to anotherI'm not really sure why you chose to perform the scenes you did.Maybe you could take some time after the performance to speak about thatspecific scene before you start a broader analysis.Particularly at the beginning of class, there seemed to be some confusion on what thepresenters were trying to convey.  If they could open the discussion by presenting a clear idea as they did with their responses, there might be less bewildered silence.I would have liked to see more scenes, it would have helped to see some of the elementsthat were brought up in the discussions.Better memorization of the acting linesI think that everybody needs to involve themselves in the discussion instead of just a fewpeople.A little boring Have more members of the group speak Better explanation of scenes More preparation I feel like the scene performances could have been more interesting. The purpose of performing them is to better demonstrate what the text is trying to communicate, but I felt like they were just reciting what was written without any real character. Also, the talking during presentation could have been more evenly distributed. They depended too much on the audience. It created many awkward silences. Don't let the entire presentation be based on questions for the audience. -I think we could have improved by knowing the lines better and rehearsing more. -I think the presentation can be improved if the analysis portion was more structured instead of hopping from one topic top another. MIT OpenCourseWarehttp://ocw.mit.edu 21L.010 / 21W.734J Writing with Shakespeare�� Fall 2010 For information about citing these materials or our Terms of Use, visit: http://ocw.mit.edu/terms.

1.  Choose a short passage that allows you to investigate the details closely.   Here, for example, is a paragraph in Mary Shelley’s Frankenstein, Vol. 1, Ch. 
2) you have moved from exposition (explaining or summarizing what’s there) to arguing a point, which will involve your reader in a more interactive and risky encounter; 
3) you have carved out your own reading of the text rather than taking the more well-worn path;  
4) you have identified something about Shelley’s method that may well open up other areas of the text for study and debate.  Bravo! 
1. Getting Started—Make sure you understand all comments on the essay.  See me if they’re illegible. —Look up grammatical, usage, and stylistic errors in the style manual.—Decide what areas you want to concentrate on in your revision; you may not be able to cover every possible issue. 
2.  What’s the Big Idea? —Reconsider your thesis and argument.  Even if they were clear and effective in the original, see what you can do to improve.   —Try to narrow and focus your thesis.  Apply the “so what?” test.  Ask yourself if anyone would argue against this thesis; if not, find a way to take a more controversial or specific position. — Ask yourself if your thesis is an observation or an argument. and try to avoid committing yourself to an observation that other alert readers would be able to make for themselves. —Check your evidence.  Have you derived your argument from a close reading of language and details in the text or have you relied on generalizations?—Look at the introduction and conclusion.  Make sure the introduction sets up the argument, showing the significance of your point.  Try to make your conclusion provocative and interesting.  More than summarizing your argument, it should show its implications in a larger context.  Try to keep the reader thinking after the paper is over. 
1.  He found it a little odd, though, that Cindi had not called and notified him about a change in plans.  He was especially concerned that something was wrong because Cindi had always called on Gary’s birthday.  On Saturday, he called Cindi’s friends, none of whom had seen her.  He visited the café, but learned that it had been closed since  3Thursday.  They called the house several times only to get an answering machine.  They drove to the house to find that it was locked up, so they checked all the windows to see if they could see anything wrong.  Everything looked fine.  On Sunday morning, they called one more time, leaving a message for Cindi to call and saying that if they didn’t hear back in a little while, they were going to call the police.  When again they got no answer, Anita called the police who joined them at Tom and Cindi’s house.        The house was empty upon arrival.  Silent.  Lifeless.  The police and Gary scoured it room by room for clues as to where the couple had gone.  A spontaneous vacation?  An anniversary cruise?  Where could they possibly be?  Gary entered the garage.  Lying on the ground was Tom’s body.  The police quickly followed with a discovery of their own: a suicide note written by Tom.  The contents revealed the location of Cindi.  Hoping the letter was not true, the police slowly opened the door of the freezer.  Of all the lies and deceit that exuded from Tom, for once he had spoke the truth.  Just as the suicide letter had indicated, there lay the delicate body of a petite, blonde female.       The news report read like a Patricia Cornwell crime novel.  Choked, strangled, suffocated, poisoned, dumped.  The words used seemed appropriate to describe the details of one of Conrwell’s gory murder scenes.  I struggled to read the entire article.  Frankly, every sentence brought a challenge.  I couldn’t imagine how anyone could be capable of inflicting such harm on someone else, let alone a husband murder his own wife.  The suicide notes left by Tom helped assemble the completely incomprehensible parts of the murder-suicide mystery, while the detectives filled in the missing pieces with their own speculations.  An argument had ensued, perhaps leading to the violence that followed, they proposed.  Tom, victim of his own ego, rage, and anger, wrapped an electrical cord around Cindi’s neck, tied a knot, and strangled her. Then,  4he placed her body in a chest freezer so as to preserve her body so she could “look good for the funeral”, as audaciously stated in another note written by Tom to Cindi’s parents.  The detectives initially believed Cindi was still alive when he put her in the freezer, but further analysis proved otherwise.  Rubbing salt into the wound, the note goes on to mention that Cindi wanted to die and never struggled when he strangled her.  As if he had not hurt his father-in-law enough, the letter concludes with a final stab at his Cindi’s father: “Happy Birthday Gary — I preserved her body for you”.    The profile of an abuser varies from one man to another.  He often takes on a Jekyll and ~ Hyde-type personality in which he can be caring, loving, and sensitive to the outside world but display abusive behavior behind closed doors.  The common profile of an abuser is a person who displays extreme jealousy, possessiveness, uncontrollable temper, unpredictability, and verbal abuse.  To justify his jealousy, the abuser will say it is a sign of love.  The jealousy can take on extreme forms as the abuser questions whom the spouse talks to and constantly accuses her of flirting.  An abuser can be jealous of the time a partner spends with family and friends, as was clearly the case with Cindi and Tom.  An abuser will justify his controlling behavior and possessiveness by claiming he is concerned with his spouse’s safety.  This characteristic translates to an abuser getting easily angered if the spouse comes back late from the store.  As the behavior worsens, an abuser can even start making personal decisions for the spouse, such as what clothes she should wear and when she can leave the house.  Another characteristic of abusers is that they come into a relationship strong and fast, even pressuring the spouse to  5commit to the relationship.  Finally, an abuser uses isolation as a tactic to cut off the spouse from all her resources.  Tom made sure to distance Cindi from her family and friends by moving to Florida, monitoring her phone conversations, and not allowing her to meet with family members. ~   After he had accomplished his mission, stealing the life of his wife and ruining the lives of her family and loved ones, he proceeded to finish off the destructive rampage by taking his own life.  He sat in his car parked in the garage, having just finished three bottles of wine.  Perhaps he was contemplating what he had done.  I imagine that these thoughts rushed through his mind just as the carbon monoxide enveloped his mouth, throat, and lungs.  He wrote a note from the inside of the car, stating that he had been sitting in the car for 50 minutes, but the poisoning wasn’t working.  What was going through his mind during those endless minutes?  Was he scared or proud or indifferent?  More importantly, did he feel any guilt?  Did he suffer and struggle, as he had made Cindi suffer, with the murder that weighed heavily upon him?  Did his mind eat away at itself for those 50 minutes, as the blood of his beloved wife soaked deeply into hands, the same hands that once enveloped Cindi’s in matrimony?    Upon further investigation of Cindi’s room, the police discovered some photographs and personal notes she had written to herself.  The photographs were like a visual diary of the past year of marriage to Tom.  They were a visual documentation of his ongoing physical abuse.  Picture after picture revealed the countless bruises on her body inflicted by her tyrannical husband.  The notes she wrote were equally as chilling.  On the anniversary of her brother Jeff’s death, about two months after she married Tom, she wrote a note about the irony of how here she was fearing for her own life.  Her writings revealed that his abuse extended beyond physical  6afflictions, and entailed verbal, psychological, and sexual violence.  She described how Tom beat her: that she feared for her life so much that she couldn’t sleep at night, afraid of what might happen to her.  How he wouldn’t give any freedom: Tom wouldn’t allow her to have friends, be around other people, or go to any parties.  How he talked down to her: telling he that she was worth nothing and that the business and house were all his.  Telling her that she was a peasant, that she was from the gutter.  He talked down to her so much that she lost all self esteem.  How he treated her like a sex slave, forcing her to have intercourse with his friends.  How he threatened to kill her mom, dad, and brother if she told anyone of her secret life or tried to escape.  She even discovered that he had been searching the Internet to purchase a gun with which he planned to kill his ex-wife.       Physical violence is the most obvious sign of abuse that preys on the comfort of the ~ partner.  It encompasses assault with a weapon, shoving, slapping, punching, choking, kicking, holding, binding, denial of sleep or nutrition, and ultimately murder.  Psychological abuse is employed in order to render the victim helpless and completely dependent on the abuser.  Such abuse includes threats of physical harm, intimidation, coercion, degradation, humiliation, false accusations, and a recently developed form of abuse known as cyberstalking.  Through sexual abuse, a batterer objectifies women with nonconsensual or painful sexual acts that are often unprotected from pregnancy or STDs.  Abuse can also include forcefully isolating one from communicating with friends, family, or relatives.  In such a situation, the abuser can make communicating with outsiders so difficult that the abused stops even trying.  This was a tactic  7employed by Cindi’s husband, as in his desire for total control and power over his wife, he did not share any part of her with the outside world.   ~    The detectives found Cindi’s wedding ring on the floor in the kitchen.  It had appeared to have been thrown, maybe in anger or rage, suggesting a fight had recently occurred.  Perhaps this was Cindi’s first and last action of defiance.  Maybe this was the night she planned to stand her ground, look the demon in his eyes and stare him back down to reality.  Maybe that night was the night Cindi had decided for herself that she would no longer be the pawn in his vicious games of power.  It could have possibly been the night she would throw that expensive diamond ring, the emblem of his failed promises of love and protection, right in his face and walk away a liberated woman.  As she threw the ring to the ground, she could finally break free from the shackles of pain and abuse and suffering.  He might have been able to inflict those scars and bruises, but they would not nearly amount to the strength of her courage and character, she would tell him as she released the ring into the air.  At least, that is what I hope she was thinking.  The police think that perhaps she was planning to leave and that he had discovered it.  Her father found that Cindi had a secret savings account that she was putting money into.  At the time of her death, the account contained upwards of $75,

1. Compare any of the arguments (offered by either Cleanthes or Philo) in Hume=s Dialogues with the overall position of Paley in his Natural Theology in any way that will illuminate and contrast the character of both.  For example, much of the discussion at the outset of the Dialogues concerns the closeness or exactness of the analogy from artificial (human-made) things to natural thingsBstairs were meant for climbing, and feet were obviously meant for walkingBand whether any particular degree of similarity is required for Cleanthes=s argument;  in contrast, Paley insists upon identity, a basic discrimination between designed and undesigned things.  Again, Cleanthes begins by asking us to observe the universe (not any easy thing to do);  in Chapter XXII, Paley argues that astronomy is not the best place to look for the evidence of design. 
2.  In his early notebooks, Darwin expresses impatience with a contemporary who argued that the Almighty had adapted the length of the night to the needs of human beings for sleep, instead of seeing sleep as an adaptation to the length of the night.  He calls this Aan expression of arrogance@.  Yet he never ceased to admire Paley, who said (in Chapter XVII) that Athe relation of sleep to night appears to me to be a relation which was expressly intended.@  Explain why Paley is not judged for arrogance by elaborating Paley on this and other points in a way that reflects the concern of his book. 
3.  The opening chapters of Paley=s text develop an extensive consideration of issues raised by finding a watch.  Is the example well-chosen?  How is it developed?  What arguments are the development intended to address?  Discuss the choice of exampleBwould another have done as well, less well, or better, and why? 
4.  Paley freely admits the imperfections of the created world, which is marked, as he says, by Aexpedients@, which are the refuge of imperfection.  (Chapter III and again in Chapter XVI)  Offering an example, he explains that humans lose their first set of teeth and develop a second so that their would not be gaps between the teeth as the skull expands with growth.  Is this example a good one for illustrating Aimperfection@?  In any case, Paley take the existence of imperfections and the expedients that remedy them to be the strong point of an argument for the existence of God.  How does his argument work here?  Compare Paley=s idea of imperfection and of its character as evidence for the existence of God with those of any other writer read so far this term. 
5.  Adam Smith=s ambition was to describe what he called Apolitical economy@ (in contrast to what was called Athe economy of nature@, which is now term Aecology@) as a self-regulating system, much as Newton tried to enable descriptions of periodic relations in nature as self-regulating systems whose occasional irregularities could be explained by showing that they conformed to the regularities of some larger system of which they were a part.  (It follows, of course, that the universe taken as a whole is entirely regular.)  How does self-regulation work in Smith=s economic system?  What is wealth in his view?  How does it come into existence?  The natural measure of value in Newton is momentum, defined as a ratio of the values of mass and acceleration, which is constant in any system.  What is the natural measure of value in Smith?  Why does Smith think that the rise and fall of the value of things can be measured only against this constant and that the monetary price of things does not express their real value? 
6.  Adam Smith, writing twenty-two years before Malthus, seems to be saying something very like Malthus (in the chapter entitled AThe Wages of Labour@) when he says that no species can multiply beyond its means of subsistence and that scarcity of subsistence regulates the production of men as it does any other commodity.  And yet he does not reach Malthus=s gloomy conclusions.  How does he avoid them?  Is there anything about the Adivision of labor@ (which Malthus never mentions in the first edition of his Principles) that makes a difference to the argument? 
7.  According to Adam Smith, when everyone tries to serve his or her interests, the result is that the actions of all, taken together, necessarily enhance the annual revenue of the society;  to use his famous metaphor, one is Aled by an invisible hand to promote an end which was no part of one=s intention,@  namely, the good of society, and to do this better than if one actually tried to do it.   How does Adam Smith account for this? In this context it might be said that where the general interest of society was concerned, Smith believed that the best motivation is enlightened self interest.  Develop a thesis about Smith=s principle of enlightened self interest and test your thesis in the context of Malthus=s Essay or Voltaire=s Candide. 
8.  Malthus applied the principle of population to both plants and animals.  But the bulk of his argument seems to apply only to mankind, since it is humankind that increases geometrically, while mankind=s food supply (plants and animals) increases only arithmetically.  Is there a contradiction here?  Put the case for and against the existence of a contradiction on this point and argue for one against the other. 
9.  Malthus suggests that it is criminal receive charity and the recipient is an enemy to all those who work for their living.  How deeply is this notion embedded in his general argument?  Further, Malthus argues that inequality is natural to humankind and that attempts to depart from it by way of social improvements will always fail.  Elucidate his argument.  To what extent does Malthus see a function in the existence of a privileged class?  Is the existence of such a class, on the whole, a good or a bad thing in his view?  Assuming that we agree with Malthus, how appropriate would the phrase Athe best of all possible worlds@ be to a world which has a privileged class?  To what extent, if any, do you think Malthus=s concept of natural inequality holds in an age of advanced technology? Does technology have the potential to eliminate the Malthusian predicament? 
10. Compare the theodicies (i.e., the justifications of God=s goodness) in Paley and Malthus, and how each of them relates to the overall views of its author. 
11. Darwin described his theory as Athe doctrine of Malthus applied with manifold force to the whole animal and vegetable kingdoms; for in this case there can be no artificial increase of food, and no prudential restraint from marriage.@  How Malthusian is Darwin=s theory? 
12. Darwin never mentioned Adam Smith as a source but his notion of the origin of species bears obvious marks of derivation from writers upon the new science of Apolitical economy@, who regarded Adam Smith as their progenitor.  How ASmithian@ is Darwin=s theory?  How strong is the analogy between Adam Smith=s Ainvisible hand@ and the description of natural selection given on p.  91 of the Origin, where we are told that natural selection Ais daily and hourly scrutinising, throughout the world, every variation, even the slightest; rejecting that which is bad, preserving and adding up all that is good; silently and insensibly working . . . at the improvement of each organic being . .  .@?  How weak is the analogy?  Is there a Ageneral interest@ of nature served by Natural Selection? 
13.  There is a particular implication in the idea of an Ainvisible hand@ that Smith never makes explicitBnamely, that something which is the result of human activity can appear the work of an intelligence smarter than any of the humans whose activity resulted in it.  This notion made its appearance in the Dialogues by Smith=s good friend, David Hume, who has Philo say: But were this world ever so perfect a production, it must still remain uncertain, whether all the excellences of the work can justly be ascribed to the workman. If we survey a ship, what an exalted idea must we form of the ingenuity of the carpenter who framed so complicated, useful, and beautiful a machine? And what surprise must we feel, when we find him a stupid mechanic, who imitated others, and copied an art, which, through a long succession of ages, after multiplied trials, mistakes, corrections, deliberations, and controversies, had been gradually improving?  The same idea is repeated in Darwin with slight modification.  In the last chapter, he urges us to look on organisms as we would any mechanical invention, not as a savage looks at a ship, but as a ship isBthe summing up of the labors, experience, reasonings and even blunders of innumerable workmen.  Can something be smarter than those who make it?  How important is this idea to the gist of what Darwin, Hume and Smith are saying? 
14.  Armed with his concept of a natural measure of value Awhich is the same in all times and all places@, Adam Smith describes a system in which the market value of anything will hover about its true value.  (Ch VII: AThe natural price, therefore, is, as it were, the central price, to which the prices of all commodities are continually gravitating.@)  The image here is that of the balance, in which the scale hovers minutely about the real weight.  Darwin, too, sees hovering and balance in nature.  Consider his invented example concerning cats, mice and clover in Chapter III of the Origin.  And yet Nature is not stable but constantly changing.  How adequate is the image of the balance to what Darwin is talking about?  Is there any constant value Awhich is the same in all times and all places@ as in Smith. 
15.  In the same connection, consider the development of life on Earth.  In the penultimate paragraph of the last chapter, Darwin alludes to it as Aprogress@:  AAnd as natural selection works solely by and for the good of each being, all corporeal and mental endowments will tend to progress towards perfection.@  Is life, in any or all of its forms, getting more and more perfect?  Perfect in what way or what function?  In this connection, we should consider Darwin=s remarks elsewhere in the Origin and particularly at the end of Chapter six, where perfection is defined as Abeing slightly more perfect@ than anything else in the ambient ecology.  Certainly, if we compare the present with the monocellular beginnings of life, both the biosphere itself at present and the organisms within it will exhibit greater complexity of organization.  But is Darwin=s view of increasing complexity an idea of increasing perfection?  Again, Darwin does not think that the organic structures of individual species were less complicated in, say, the Mesozoic than in the Cenozoic periods.  The last sections of Chapter IV constitute an extended meditation on the direction of life=s development  since the Cambrian period and the direction in which it may be heading.  How does this meditation compare with the notion of progress, in the usual sense of the word? 
16.  Darwin writes:  AI use the term >Struggle for Existence= in a large and metaphorical sense . . .@ (p. 
17.  Taking a direct cue from Paley=s discussion of the eye and telescope, Darwin examines Aorgans of extreme perfection@ in the Origin, including the eye (pp. 185-89, 201-
18.  Darwin did not invent the tree metaphor that he invokes as an image of life (pp. 130-
19.  Darwin answers certain criticisms of his theory, most pointedly in chapter six (ADifficulties on Theory@) and in chapter seven, which deals with inherited instincts (we read the last pages), but he answers potential objections or misconceptions at other points, too.  Later, in the last chapter, he argues that those who have been looking for a lifetime at nature through the spectacles of one theory are going to have trouble looking at nature through the spectacles of another.  Find some few instances of objection or misconception (anywhere from two on up) and give the objection the best run for its money that you can;  then offer Darwin=s answer and show how it relates to Darwin=s overall view. 
20.  Suppose that Voltaire had got hold of a copy of Darwin=s Origin and was sufficiently in advance of his time to have understood its argument.  How would he have applied the phrases Asufficient reason@ and Abest of all possible worlds@ to it?  Alternatively:  The phrase Abest of all possible worlds@ sounds upbeat but it may express the same pessimism as the phrase AThis is as good as it gets@.  With reference to the idea that Nature is a system, does Darwin lend support to the use of the phrase in either of these senses or is it irrelevant to his argument? 
21.  In causal relations, a necessary condition for the occurrence of an event is a state of affairs without which the event cannot happen, while a sufficient condition is a state of affairs that guarantees that it will happen.  The idea behind the principle of sufficient reason is that you have not understood the existence of anything (or the occurrence of any event) until you have identified its sufficient reason.  (It follows, of course, that anything that can be understood was bound to happen.)  How much scope is there in Darwin=s argument for the use of these two concepts? 
22.  Here is an excerpt from chapter 8 of Aristotle=s Physics: Why should not nature work, just as the sky rains, not in order to make the corn grow, but of necessity? What is drawn up must cool, and what has been cooled must become water and descend, the result of this being that the corn grows. Similarly if a man=s crop is spoiled on the threshing-floor, the rain did not fall Afor the sake of@ thisBin order to spoil the cropBbut that result just followed. Why then should it not be the same with the parts in nature, for example, that our teeth should come up of necessityBthe front teeth sharp, fitted for tearing, the molars broad and useful for grinding down the foodBpresuming that they did not arise for this end, but it was merely a coincident result; and so with all other parts in which we suppose that there is purpose? Wherever, then, among all the parts that came about, some came about fortuitously  just as they would have done if they had come about for an end, these things would survive, being organized by mere chance in a fitting way; whereas those which grew otherwise perished and continue to perish, as Empedocles says his Aman-faced ox-progeny@ did. The passage discusses necessity and mere chance and opposes to these things the kind of agency in which things happen Afor the sake of something@.  How close is the view that Aristotle is dismissing to Darwin=s.  What kind of an agency (the cause of something) is Natural Selection? What would Darwin say about this passage? 
23. From Darwin=s The Descent of Man: The advancement of the welfare of mankind is a most intricate problem: all ought to refrain from marriage who cannot avoid abject poverty for their children; for poverty is not only a great evil, but tends to its own increase by leading to recklessness in marriage. On the other hand,... if the prudent avoid marriage, whilst the reckless marry, the inferior members tend to supplant the better members of society. Man, like every other animal, has no doubt advanced to his present high condition through a struggle for existence consequent on his rapid multiplication; and if he is to advance still higher, it is to be feared that he must remain subject to a severe struggle. Otherwise he would sink into indolence, and the more gifted men would not be more successful in the battle of life than the less gifted. Hence our natural rate of increase, though leading to many and obvious evils, must not be greatly diminished by any means. There should be open competition for all men; and the most able should not be prevented by laws or customs from succeeding best and rearing the largest number of offspring. Darwin deals here with the issues raised by Malthus. Develop a thesis and compare Darwin and Malthus in some detail on their social views. Darwin seems to advocate a laissez-faire (leave things alone) policy, unconstrained by legal or moral principles, in the production of offspring. Is Darwin=s view more sensible than or simply the same as Malthus=s? 
1.  The word physis in Greek means nature; the title of this book might well be The Nature of things. Aristotle believes that understanding anything has to do with identifying the sort of thing it is and that this identification depends upon being able to identify its inherent principle of change—change in appearance, in location, in motion. Do we believe that change is inherent in things? Or is it always induced by externalities? Or a combination of both? 
2. 	 Understanding the nature of things depends upon asking the right questions about them. The answers, for Aristotle, are aitaia - word usually translated as causes, but perhaps better translated as becauses, for they are the answer to a properly formulated question about why something is the way it is. Aristotle offers four aitai. What are they? Can you give an account of them? 
3. 	 We can easily think of kinds of things that have no intellectual significance (Example: all physical objects that are approximately five inches from the nearest wall) or things that might have significance but do not exist (phlogiston, witches); but Aristotle believes that everyday perception and a trained intelligence can see into the nature of things—get at the inherent principle of change in things. Is this a naive assumption? Is it still in operation today? 
4. 	 The inherent tendency to change is called eidos by Aristotle—usually translated as form, but it is also the ancient Greek word for idea and also for species. Do you see any connection between these things? He has a quarrel with the philosopher Antiphon about whether eidos is inherent or external in chapter one of Book II. What is the nature of the quarrel? 
5. 	 Aristotle believes that there are two features of the world that do not submit to understanding the nature of things - luck or chance (tyche) and spontaneity or coincidence (automaton). What is his understanding of these features and how does it differ from our own? 
6. 	 Inherent principles of change each make for change in a particular way. This way is called its telos, its end, its aim, its goal. Things in the world all possess a telos, and the purposeful activities of human beings constitute only one sort of teleological activity. Do we still employ teleological descriptions of the nature and activity of things? If things are properly described teleologically, does it follow that they have purposes? 
7. 	 In chapter eight, Aristotle considers the idea that things happen, not "for the sake of something", that is, in accordance with an end, an aim, or a goal, but rather of necessity, "just as rain falls, not to make crops grow but of necessity." What is his argument against this view? Lecture 3: Carroll, Lewis. Alice's Adventures in Wonderland. 
8. 	 By the same token, the remarks of the creatures in Wonderland do not seem to make any sense, but sometimes turn out to be sensible, once you grant the odd circumstances in which the creatures live. At the Mad Tea-Party, for instance, Alice thinks of one of the Hatter's remarks that it "seemed to have no sort of meaning in it, and yet it was certainly English." Although Alice does not notice the fact, the rest of the conversation makes the Hatter's remark clear. What is the meaning of it? Find other events and circumstances in the story that can be described in sentences that might seem to have no sort of meaning to them and yet are certainly English. How easy is it to describe everyday realities in ways that seem to have no sort of meaning to them and yet are certainly English? Does it tell us anything about the ways in which we live that we can describe them as riddles? 
9. 	 A good deal of the book has to do with changing size. How would Aristotle's causes fit the changes endured by Alice in the book? Lecture 4: Voltaire. Candide. 
10. Elucidate the meaning of what appears to be the book's final lesson—that we should cultivate our own garden. How well does the phrase sum up the meaning of the book as a whole? Lecture 5: Hume. Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion. (Through Book V in the excerpts.) 
11. When Philo (in Part VIII) introduces the notion that, given an infinity of time the chance movements of atoms alone must sooner or later create an ordered universe, Cleanthes counters with the thought that the universe is not merely ordered but is benevolently ordered. Rightly or wrongly, the difference between organized ideas and disorderly or random matter is presented as intuitively apparent by Philo; is it intuitively apparent that the arrangment of things in the world is benevolently intended? Suppose it looks like a benevolent arrangement: why cannot the random motions of atoms create it, given an infinity of time? In any case, is this turn in the argument a novelty or is their an ethical idea lurking in the very notion that the various parts of the world are well fitted to each other? 
12. In Part X, Philo succinctly poses "the problem of evil". What is your sense of this problem? Is it a real one? Cleanthes believes that the problem affords the clearest evidence of the advantage of his view of God. Is he right? 
13. At the end of the dialogue, the transcriber of them offers the judgment that Cleanthes argued best in the discussion. Most scholars believe that Hume wrote this view into the end of his text in order to pacify the majority of his readers, who were possibly not ready for outright skepticism with regard to religious matter; these scholar hold that Philo gets the best of the argument. What is your view? Lecture 6: Hume. Dialogues. (remainder) Lecture 7: Paley. Natural Theology. 
14. Like most important notions, the concept of adaptation is not straightforward. One might suppose that a sheep capable of browsing both on mountainsides and level plains and therefore adept at the area in between would have a selective advantage over sheep capable of just doing one or the other, but Darwin argues for the reverse conclusion. What is his reasoning and how important is the issue to his theory? 
15. The idea of the eye as an "organ of extreme perfection" was already dealt with in Hume's Dialogue. It was a well-entrenched idea and the source of much early criticism of Darwin's views. What difficulty does the idea of "organs of extreme perfection" raise for Darwin's theory? How well does he deal with it? What becomes of the notion of perfection in his hands? 
16. In this connection, an important idea in Darwin's time was the notion that every sort of creature is extremely well-adjusted by reason of its anatomy to its necessities and to the habits that go with satisfying them. This adjustment of habit with anatomy and of both to the creature's habitat was an important point in the theory of special creation. What is the theory of special creation? What are its ramifications in thinking about the biosphere as a whole? What Darwin's view of this theory and why does he take the position that he occupies with respect to it? 
17. Darwin distinguished between analogy and homology in identifying the "characters" or traits of different species. What is this distinction and how important is it to Darwin's conception of the adaptiveness of organisms to their habitats? 
18. In connection with our reading of Paley, we have encountered the notion that many natural philosophers took an anthropocentric view of the design-features of organisms, arguing that e.g., the hump of the camel was created for the benefit of nomads, who might have a beast of burden fit for desert places. In this connection, a familiar example was the rattle of the rattlesnake, which many believed was put there by a benevolent Providence to warn reasonable creatures of the danger posed by the rattlesnake. Darwin's term for a generalized version of this notion is the utilitarian theory, the idea that creatures have traits whose primary function is to benefit other creatures. How does Darwin deal with the "utilitarian theory"? Darwin poured particular scorn on the theory about the rattlesnake. How would he explain the existence of the rattle in the tail of the rattlesnake? 
19. A prime example of the "utilitarian theory" concerned the adaptation of the social insects to the interests of the group, the most familiar instance being the sting of the bee, which is fatal to the insect that uses it. Why does this instance raise a difficulty for Darwin's theory and how does he deal with it? 
20. Several times in the book, Darwin cites the maxim: "Nature is prodigal in variety, though niggard in invention." What does this phrase mean? He believes that his theory can explain the truth of the maxim and the theory of "special creation" cannot. Why? In your view, is the truth of the maxim confined to the biological world or does it apply to civilization as well? 
21. Near the end of his book, Darwin repeats Hume's analogy about the savage, looking on a ship as a wondrous contrivance quite beyond human comprehension. Explore the analogy in the context of Darwin's argument. Which side would Darwin have taken, Philo's or Cleanthes's? 
22. How would Darwin speak about "the environment", should he have been transported to the present and stumbled across this phrase?Lecture 12: Darwin. On the Origin of Species.(continued) Lecture 13: Darwin. On the Origin of Species.(continued) Lecture 14: Butler, Samuel. Erewhon.

1.  Write a meditative essay on the place of community in the treatment of depression. (This assignment is a reflection of our earlier brainstorming session on this topic, so any issue we raised is fair game.) Place yourself in conversation with The Noonday Demon and any other relevant sources. 
2.  Write a meditative essay on the function of the doctor in terms of the geopolitics of medicine. In what sense is the doctor responsible to the world as well as the local community? How should this responsibility manifest in practice? This version of the assignment will require that you read ahead into the material on nursing and Doctors without Borders. It can also be placed into dialogue with Anne Fadiman, Jared Diamond, or the earlier material on the Hippocratic Corpus.

1. Plato writes in this peculiar form, a dialog with more than one character. What impact does this have on the strength  of  his  arguments  and  what  impact  on  the nature of his project? 
2. Plato writes three speeches on love. What is the point of having three speeches, what lesson do we learn from this  multiplicity  of  speeches?  In  the  speech  Plato seems  most  committed  to,  Socrates  outlines  a  theory about how souls are like horses and riders, galloping around  the  universe.  Does  this  image  have  any  power over us modern readers? Why or why not? 
3. Plato  argues  that  the  ultimate  rhetoric  is  that rhetoric  inscribed  on  the  soul  of  a  man.  What  does this mean, and do you buy it?  Finally,  each  group  should  find  one  argument  in  Plato’s dialog  that  seems  effective  and  one  that  does  not  seem effective.

1)  What does your character WANT?  (One word, or a VERY short phrase.  Nothing complicated.  What does your character want IN THIS STORY?)                        What are his/her motives for wanting this?    Where in the story is it made clear to the reader?       HOW is this information made clear to the reader?  (Dialog? Actions? Interior thinking?)     What or who stands in the way of the character achieving this? What does that desire set in motion? 1 
2)  Name 10 things that you character carrying in his or her pockets/bag/backpack. 
3.  
4.  
5.  
6.  
7.  
8.  
9.  
10.      
1.  Identify a single incident or event in the story you are working on OR a single incident in your life, or choose from one of the scenarios on the suggestion sheet.  Write the event in the first person from the point of view of the protagonist or from YOUR point of view if it’s from your own experience.  (This should ideally be a “French scene”, which means that the incident starts when two people meet and ends when they part or when a third person enters the scene.)  Always remember to identify for yourself what each character WANTS in each scene.  THIS SCENE SHOULD BE NO MORE THAN 200 WORDS.  PLEASE WRITE LEGIBLY. 1 
2.  Now write the incident in the third person.  Again, this should be NO MORE than 200 words.  Fewer is fine. 2
3.  Write the scene from the Other Character’s point of view (this may be first person or intimate third.)  And, of course, this should be the same length as the others. 3Potential Scenarios  Remember, EVERY scene advances the characters’ understanding and their agendas.  Make sure you identify what each character wants in the scene and how they try to get it from the other person in this scene.   There must be some conflict of agendas (but remember, that does not have to necessarily be overt between the characters.  They may possibly not speak to each other, or speak very little.  They may be unaware of each other’s agenda.)  Do not forget to draw the scene in full, to make sure you have a sense of place. NOTE!  These are only suggestions to get your imagination going.  If you like one of them, that’s fine.  If you don’t like any and have another idea, that’s fine too.  
4.   Two strangers in a company waiting area are both interviewing for the same job (or believe they are.)  
5.  Two acquaintances run into each other (at a party, in the library, doing laundry.)  They have only been casual acquaintances so far, but one wants to ask the other for a date.  
6.  A landlord/landlady telling a tenant that he/she must move.  
7.  A dating couple.  One has just received his/her acceptance into the best graduate program in the country, but it is far away.  
8.  A young child wants an expensive toy.  
9.  Two friends are hosting a party together.  During the party, one of the hosts sees something that is wrong or unsettling (or something that 4could be taken as wrong or unsettling but may be ambiguous) done by the other host’s guests.  
10. Two old friends.  One owes the other a significant amount of money.  5MIT OpenCourseWarehttp://ocw.mit.edu21W.755 / 21W.757 Writing and Reading Short StoriesSpring 2012For information about citing these materials or our Terms of Use, visit: http://ocw.mit.edu/terms.

4. You must give a final polish to Essay 5,  including either a page of Sources, listed alphabetically, or a “For Further Reading” page that divides sources into topics, and which lists sources alphabetically within categories.  What, Why and How In a simple 2-pocket folder, please arrange your drafts and cover sheets as follows:    • • • In the left-hand pocket, please put drafts of Essay 1-4, with most recent draft on top in each set. In the right-hand pocket, put drafts of Essay 5 and Portfolio Cover Letter. If you did free-writing in class for Essay 5 and/or other essays, please include that, too.  •  Do NOT print out clean drafts of essays—I want the ones that are marked up with my comments.  Cover Letter  The purpose of the Portfolio is to give you and me an opportunity to reflect on your work this term. To aid in this reflection, please address the following questions in a cover letter: •  What has changed in your writing and/or your approach to writing this term? Has anything changed in your reading practice?  •  Which essay assignment stretched you the most? Explain. •  Which of your essays do you like best? Explain •  Anything else you want to comment on regarding your writing? (You will have an opportunity to comment on the course itself elsewhere.)  When and Where Portfolios are due at our final class meeting, Thursday 5/14, or my office by 10:00 a.m. Friday 5/
1)  WRITE a letter to me introducing yourself as a writer. What are your hopes,  Due for class Th 2/5     expectations, anxieties re: this class? Recent good and/or bad experiences with writing?  Approx. 1 page double-spaced.  
2)  READ the first set of essays [handouts], which reflect on science in varied ways. These are:  •  Alan Lightman’s “Smile.” With a doctorate in theoretical physics, Lightman was an active researcher in astronomy and physics for two decades; he has taught physics at both Harvard and MIT. In recent years Lightman has turned his attention to writing; the author of the novel Einstein’s Dreams and many essays, he currently teaches writing at MIT. •  Lewis Thomas’s “Crickets, Bats, Cats and Chaos.” Thomas (1913-
1)    READ our 4th set of essays, in Groopman:              Due T3/3 •  Steve Featherstone, “The Coming Robot Army,” 75-
2. Aim for “lucidity, lucidity, lucidity,” as Elise Hancock puts it. Also keep in mind that to revise means to re-see; allow yourself to re-see your essay and its possibilities—don’t be content to merely edit or polish it.   When you hand in your revision, please include the first draft with my comments and a cover sheet answering these questions:   Essay 2   Draft 2  Name  ____________________________________     
3) What was challenging about writing this essay?  
1)  READ essays on the challenges of medical science (and which present pretty dark visions, too):  Due Th 3/5                      •  David Quammen, “Deadly Contact,” 238-
2)  Write a 1-¶ proposal for Essay 
3. Indicate your proposed topic, why your topic matters (to both you and readers) and who you imagine your core readers to be. We will share these in class and I will collect them.    #      
1) Choose a topic that really interests you; 
2) Don’t try to do too much; and 
3) Anchor your discussion in the specific; don’t let it become 5 pages of abstract musings.  Sources: Use “magazine style,” that is, work important sources into your text informally—“According to the National Institutes of Health . .” and so on. As before, append your source list for my information.  The first way you may choose to approach Essay 3 is what we’ll call Life/Science: This essay will grow out of your own experience and explore the intersection of life and science: how you decided to pursue biomedical engineering, why you gave up math club for the flute, dinnertime discussions with your mother, the astronaut . . . You may focus on a person—your neighbor, the high tech entrepreneur; your high school chemistry teacher; your aunt, the pediatrician; a problem—a math problem that has long fascinated you; the challenges you encountered in a UROP or summer internship; or an experience that still resonates for you—the time you blew up your high school chem. lab, the time you almost flunked algebra, the frustrations of trying to organize a neighborhood environmental action program, your success at a science fair.    Unlike Essay 2, this assignment is not primarily expository: you will, of course, have to present facts—who, what, when, why, and how—clearly and accurately, but the value of this essay will lie in what connects those facts, namely, your reflection on your experience. One challenge: the essay is not just a memory piece written for your own pleasure; it has to make meaning in a way that engages readers, takes them somewhere they haven’t been. If, as we have said, “an essay is a record of a mind thinking,” this essay will record your thinking about science as it is lived, the “personal realm” (Kanigel) of science. But you don’t want to blather on about “how important science is to me . . .”—you want to embody your thinking in vivid examples that connect to make an intriguing pattern. To quote Rob Kanigel again, “Your topic may be slight or meaty, but it should dip into the world of fears and feelings, human bodies, human personality, the wellsprings of human creativity.”   (more)     The second way you may choose to approach Essay 3 is to focus on the social impact of some aspect of science or technology, or the relationship between culture and science: This version of Essay 3 is an invitation to think about the relationship between science and culture. This kind of thinking and writing is valuable because it helps us better understand the ways developments in science and technology affect not just the material quality of life but also the ways we imagine our collective and individual lives. You may want to explore an issue you think is often misunderstood, misrepresented, or overlooked; you may want to change your readers’ way of thinking about your chosen issues, or you may even want to recommend specific policies that you believe follow from your discussion.   This essay will succeed by considering specific cases. You may start with a feeling that you want to discuss “the excesses of technology,”  “why the environment is important,” or “the need to make modern medicine less technocratic,” but you will more likely be successful if you focus your idea more narrowly. And you will be convincing only if you provide well-developed examples to support your ideas.   Your essay is also more likely to succeed if you choose a subject about which you feel strongly and with which you have some firsthand experience as a researcher, worker or student. If you have had a lifelong passion for space exploration and don’t understand why the space program is not more visible and popular, here’s your chance to investigate and reflect on that. If you have reason to believe, from your own schooling, that better math education for all students would pay unexpected social dividends, here’s your chance to make that case.   Alternatively, you may want to explore the way some aspect of science or technology has been shaped by culture—for example, the way the culture of MIT tends to assume that technology is the solution to any given problem.  Your own experience and imagination will not suffice to make a strong case. Therefore, you will need to find appropriate sources that provide useful facts and figures, and/or experts’ arguments, whose analysis and reflection bolster your own. In short, “you must advance your case with specifics, facts and figures, names and places, clear reasoning, sensual detail, pointed quotes” (Kanigel). NOTE: Remember that our readings can be sources!    #     
1)  What has changed in this draft? Please be specific. 
2)  What is the main idea in this essay?   
3)  Whom do you imagine as your core audience? 
4)  Why does the idea matter—to you; to readers?                      
1)  What’s changed in this draft? 
2)  What’s the theme or angle that you are using to illuminate the book for readers? 
3)  Are you happy with this essay now? Why or why not? 
1)  What topic are you interested in? (1-2 sentences.) 
2)  Why this topic? (1 paragraph.) 
3)  What do you hope to learn by researching this topic and writing this essay? (A few sentences.) 
1)  Refined proposal: Answer these three questions:         Due for class Tuesday  4/14  Spring 2009  •  What is your Inquiry Question? That is, what is the question that you would like to answer, and that you think will serve to shape your essay effectively. Note: You may include subsidiary questions here, but don’t just write a list of Q.s you want to answer—really aim to come up with ONE QUESTION that will drive your research and shape your paper. •  Why does it matter? What’s at stake for you and for readers? (You may want to paste some of your original proposal here, or you may have new thoughts.) •  At this early stage, whom do you envision as your “core reader”?  
2)  Write a short Annotated Bibliography, as follows: Make an annotated bibliography of your six best sources thus far. Your sources should include at least two books. List the source, thus:  Book:  Smith, Perry. A Short History of Consumer Culture. NY: Utopia Press, 
1)  Outline: Figure out the 3 or 4 main chunks of information you will need to discuss in your essay. Come up with a heading for each section.   Examples: Populations at risk, Playing the odds, How hot?, Getting to the source…   In other words, don’t use headings like “Background,” or “Further problems”—these are generic and won’t  push your thinking very far. Instead, aim to really conceptualize the main pieces of your discussion and how they fit together. And as you work on your headings, think about your Inquiry Question: how does each chunk of the discussion lead to an answer to your question?  So: Type up your headings in bold face, and under each heading in regular font either write a paragraph on “what goes here” or provide bullet points.  If you are feeling particularly bold, or inspired, see if you can come up with a Title, too.   
2)  Introduction: You will probably want to start with a story or scene of some kind that dramatizes and encapsulates the issue you will be focusing on. Write that in 1 paragraph. Then write some sentences that provide the context in which you want readers to consider your Inquiry Question, and any background that readers will need up front to make sense of all this. Write about 2 paragraphs total. (Assume that the Introduction of your paper will ultimately take 2-3 paragraphs total.)  Remember that an Introduction has to:  •  Grab readers’ attention and make them want to keep reading  •  Forecast what this essay will be about  •  Provide a thesis and/or an Inquiry Question (in this case, I am requiring every paper to make use of a Question in the Introduction)  •  Provide context for your inquiry  •  Provide essential background (this is highly variable; it depends on your topic)  We will spend about 45 minutes in class working with these. We will also begin individual 10-12-minute conferences re: your Essay 5, esp. on making sure you have a clear focus and Inquiry Question. I’ll meet with ≈ 3 people during class time. I can meet with ≈ 3 people before class and the rest of you after class.             #    
1)  BRING to class your marked up copies of Essay 2, 3 or 4—whichever one you’d like to start re-Due for class Tuesday  5/5  Spring 2009       revising or polishing. As a way to begin thinking about revision, I’d like everyone to read 2 versions of Rachel’s Essay #2 and to consider which you think works best, and why. We’ll start class by discussing this essay. I’ll bring copies of the essay to class.   
2)  REVISE Essay 
3)  What do you like/not like about this essay in it’s latest incarnation?                           
1)  WRITE a letter to me introducing yourself as a writer. What are your hopes,      expectations, anxieties re: this class? Recent good and/or bad experiences with writing?  Approx. 1 page double-spaced.  
2)  READ the first set of essays [handouts], which reflect on science in varied ways. Due for class Th 2/7 These are:  •  Alan Lightman’s “Smile.” With a doctorate in theoretical physics, Lightman was an active researcher in astronomy and physics for two decades; he has taught physics at both Harvard and MIT. In recent years Lightman has turned his attention to writing; the author of the novel Einstein’s Dreams and many essays, he currently teaches writing at MIT. •  Lewis Thomas’s “Crickets, Bats, Cats and Chaos.” Thomas (1913-
1)  READ the 2nd set of essays, on “doing science”:      Due for class T 2/12 •  Excerpts from Rob Kanigel’s The  Man Who Knew Infinity, a biography of the mathematician Ramanujan. Prof. Kanigel heads the graduate science writing program here at MIT and has written books on various subjects (he is not a mathematician). [e-Reserve] •  Oliver Sacks’s “Remembering Francis Crick,” which first appeared in the New York Review of Books. We will learn more about Sacks, a neurologist and prolific writer, when we read his memoir of childhood in a few weeks. [E-reserve] •  Aaron Hirsh’s “Signs of Life.” Hirsh was a research fellow at Stanford and is a co-founder of the biotech company InterCell. This essay first appeared in American Scholar. [e-Reserve] •  Elizabeth Kolbert’s “Crash Course,” a New Yorker article on CERN’s Large Hadron Collider, its current particle physics experiment, and the personalities involved in the work. [MIT Library-→Vera→New Yorker→May 14, 2007→this article]        Note: Please print out all articles and essays that you access on-line or via e-Reserves so that you may mark them up, and bring them to class.  
2)  FOR CLASS DISCUSSION: Think about the contexts the writers create for their essay topics, and also about the ways the writers get—and keep—the reader’s attention. What writerly techniques do they use? Think also about the personal realm of science –for example, the question of “who does science?” and why it matters (or doesn’t?); the network of relationships involved in doing science; the role of teaching and inspiration in moving scientific knowledge forward.         #

1)  Skim Stephen Jay Gould’s essay “A Divison of Worms.” [e-Reserves]. I suspect that Gould needs no introduction, but for the record he was a prolific and influential writer on topics relating to Darwin’s theory of evolution. Gould, who passed away a few years ago, was a professor of geology and curator of paleontology at Harvard. This essay was one of his columns for Natural History. The column had run monthly since 1974 under the heading “This View of Life.” Gould has called this essay one of his favorites in his series for Natural History. Why do you imagine Gould said that—what’s at the intellectual and emotional heart of this piece?        
2)   READ our next set of essays, on the challenges of medical science—the challenges of combining a scientific approach and a humanistic one. They are:  •  “The Patient Predator” by Kevin Patterson, an internist who practices on Vancouver Island. This article first appeared in Mother Jones, and was developed with encouragement and guidance from editor Clara Jeffrey over the course of a year. •  “Desperate Measures” by Atul Gawande. This essay first appeared in the New Yorker, and it was chosen for both of the annual collections of best science essays for

(Either in the content or the writing) What questions did it raise for you? –List 3 things in answer to each question—we will begin with these. •  “John Rock…”: Why do  you think Gladwell structured this essay the way he did? Why do you think he spent so much time describing Rock’s religious faith? What do you think he wants us to take away from this essay? •  “Prisoner . . .”:  What do you think Lightman wants us to take away from this essay? Can you relate to Lightman’s concerns? What do you notice about the way he structures this essay?—List at least 3 things. #

1.  Using the Legos that they have, each player gets to build on their corner of the map. Players may not remove pieces that they have placed in previous rounds, they may only add on to what they have built. Players should build structures that can have tokens hidden in and around them.  This phase lasts 2 minutes (2 timer durations). The Master Builder (mentioned directly below) is in charge of using his or her phone to time this phase. 
2.  Players who are not the Master Builder must hide all of their pieces on their corner of the map while blindfolded. If a player destroys one of their own structures during this phase, they lose three tokens at the end of the round. This hiding phase lasts 1 minute (1 timer duration). The Master Builder is in charge of timing this phase, and must announce when only ten seconds are left.  
3.  The Master Builder is not blindfolded during the hiding phase and gets to hide a “bounty” piece and a “robber” piece in addition to their regular pieces on his/her territory. The bounty piece is a green token, and the robber piece is a black token.  At the start of the hiding phase, he/she must declare how much they are “betting”. The Master Builder is allowed to bet a number from 1 to 
4.  At the end of this phase, players tally how many tokens are on their corner of the map. Each token is worth $1, and must be used during the purchasing phase.  
5.  Player’s should be able to remove any token they hid on their part of the map without destroying or removing any building pieces. If they are unable to remove a token this way, that token is not worth anything for the following purchasing phase. 5Purchasing Phase: 
6.  At the end of the purchasing phase, the Master Builder should tally up the victory points earned   by each player as they redeem objective cards. Final Prototype Summary Our final prototype includes the building, hiding, and finding phases we developed in early prototypes.  Players are given two minutes to build structures on their corner using a set amount of Legos. Players then have one minute to hide five tokens on and within their structure while blindfolded. If they break their own structure while hiding tokens, they are penalized three tokens. For the next minute, players feel around the board and race to take tokens from their opponent’s structures, then rehide those tokens on their own territory.  At the end of the minute, players collect their tokens.  Then, they may spend their tokens in a variety of ways. They may use one token to buy four Legos, one token to buy an Objective Card, or another player’s token that they have collected to steal two Legos from that opponent’s structures. Players complete building and set collection objectives to earn Victory Points.  This preserves the game’s core building and finding mechanics while proving an overarching goal for players to strive for.  Each round, one player is assigned to be the Master Builder.  The role for Master Builder rotates each round.  The Master Builder is in charge of timing the rounds and calling out violations (e.g. if one player breaks another player’s structure).  The Master Builder is also in charge of tallying Victory Points at the end of the purchasing phase.  The Master Builder also participates in hiding pieces, although does not find pieces.  Details on the specialized pieces and betting process for the Master Builder can be found in the rules section. Findings and Reflections Given that its primary play mechanic involves the use of a sense that is not often used in modern tabletop games, I’ve Got A Feelin’ yielded many lessons into both game and experience design. Both the development process and qualitative observations from playtesting showed how players could both learn from and enjoy the novel experience of using their sense of touch instead of sight. Further lessons are possibly waiting within observations of more gameplay testing and observation, and the further development of the game, of which its lessons can be used both in designing more interesting and compelling games, and design of objects and architectures that people interact with on a day-to-day basis. Games that deprive players of common skills could also be leveraged to help them get a small taste of the difficulty of navigating a visually impaired daily life. Players of I’ve Got A Feelin’ often noted how much more difficult than expected it was to find objects, navigate and explore an unfamiliar area, and do all of the above without breaking things. Developing games like ours  could avoid the pitfalls of many 6 “political” and “edutainment” games through its deeper and more complex gameplay and more genuinely entertaining mechanics. The primary game mechanic of blindness had the effect of humbling players and letting their guards down, as they were competing using skills that they knew that neither they or their opponents were well versed in, creating a light-hearted atmosphere. Conversely, depriving players of their primary sense of sight compounded the boredom of waiting when they had no designated task in the game compounded boredom with a feeling of helplessness. Gameplay design that emphasizes on non-traditional skills can also be used in the design of other, more utilitarian experiences. For example, player behavior from the touch-based navigation of our game could be used to better design rooms and living spaces to be more easily navigated by touch, whether it is during emergency power outagesß or simply getting a glass of water at night in the dark. Additionally, games like ours can be used to study how to best design public spaces so that they are more easy to explore and navigate by blind and visually impaired people who are unfamiliar with the space. Given that many researchers are already aware that games have an extremely high, untapped potential for teaching, it should be no surprise that games like I’ve Got A Feelin’ also have the potential for use in training players to improve spacial reasoning and manual dexterity. Within the limited play time that testers had, they demonstrated an impressive array of different, lateral-thinking strategies, hinting at the game’s ability to foster creative thinking and cultivate new ways of approaching problems given a set of unusual constraints.  7MIT OpenCourseWarehttps://ocw.mit.eduCMS.301 Introduction to Game Design MethodsSpring 2016For information about citing these materials or our Terms of Use, visit: https://ocw.mit.edu/terms.
1. America the Violent, America the Psychotic. Choose two of the following: American History X; Fargo; American Psycho (the novel). (You can also write about just Ellis’ novel, if you like.)  Articulate your understanding of what Slotkin’s argument is about the role of violence in American mythology. Then make an argument about how your chosen text(s) suggest their own theory about the relationship between “Americanness” and “violence.”  Do they agree with Slotkin, or offer their own versions of similar claims as his, or do they suggest something that seems really different from Slotkin’s formulation?   What is the signifier “American” to these texts: how do they define it, and what textual evidence suggests that definition?  Is it a simple or complex term?  Does national identity mix in with class, race, gender, sexuality, or other forms of identity?  What about the role of history, temporality, family in relation to violence (consider both senses of that key word “generation” in Slotkin’s argument)?  Does “Americanness” change at all over the  1  21L.435 Violence and Contemporary Representation Questions for Paper # 1   course of the text?  Is it something that can change or adapt or become otherwise?  Invert the phrase and consider each formulation: is there something uniquely violent about America / is there something uniquely American about violence?  These texts can be read as argumentative, even didactic: do they offer only a diagnosis of the problematic or also an account of how change or another sense of national identity might be possible?   
2. Blankness / Nothingness. Choose two of the following: American Psycho (the novel); American Psycho (the film); Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer; Se7en.  Or, you can just write about Ellis’ novel if you like. Make an argument about the way(s) in which the texts use the concept of blankness, nothingness, or absence.  Be sure to be as specific as possible in defining your terms: blankness might be linked to gaps, omissions, ellipses, opacity, ambiguity, avowals of nothingness, white space, missing things, illegible things, darkness, unrealized canvases, etc.  So articulate what kind of blank or nothing you’re making a claim about.   Describe how your chosen texts deploy the figuration of blankness or nothingness that you’re focusing on, and make an argument about how this figure relates to the text’s theory of violence. Does that figure change over the course of the text? Do different media forms deal with blankness and nothingness in different ways?  And what does this figure mean for reading, spectatorship, and/or critique?  Does it foreclose judgment, evaluation, understanding of violence, or does it enable those modes of thought?    
3. The Staging of the Corpse. Choose two of the following: American Psycho (the novel); American Psycho (the film); Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer; Se7en. Make an argument about the way(s) in which the texts/films stage, display, visualize, structure, present and represent the corpse. The corpse is a specific form of the (dead, hurt, material) corpus—so it is like a body, but also not quite like a body.  Describe how your chosen works treat the corpse (as a visual or plastic or material object) and make an argument about how this staging of the corpse relates to the films’ theory or use of violence. How does a film’s visual treatment of the corpse parallel or depart from the diegetic serial killer’s treatment of the corpse?  (In other words, is it the killer or the aesthetic work that stages the corpse, and does it matter which is the directorial agent?)  You should stay focused on your chosen texts, but in your conclusion you might make a larger claim about the relationship between staging (art, artifice, artificiality, presentation) and violence, using the corpse as a means to make a broader argument about your chosen films. The corpse is the human as a form of meat and flesh, as a form of plastic, as an object and artifact: does the staging of the corpse in your texts mitigate violence (aestheticize or sanitize it) or is staging yet another way violence takes place?   
4. Abnormal Normality. Unpack Seltzer’s argument about the role of the normal or typicality in relation to the serial killer. (You might also consider Freeland’s arguments here  2  21L.435 Violence and Contemporary Representation  as well.)  Then choose two of the following: American History X; American Psycho (the novel); American Psycho (the film); Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer; Se7en. What is the role of the average, the normal, the typical in your chosen texts?   Questions for Paper # 1  How do formal techniques figure the typical as typical; in turn, do formal techniques (saturation, repetition, exaggeration, literalization) make the typical atypical or the familiar unfamiliar?  You should interrogate the key terms of this question: what do you understand normality to mean in your chosen texts, and how does that term get figured, defined, negotiated, renegotiated and upset over the course of the texts?  You might want to pluralize the terms and suggest how the average, normal, ordinary, typical, etc., works differently in different texts. How does Seltzer’s theorization of identity relate to violence?  What is violent about the normal, or what is normal about violence?  Does the conjoining of typicality and violence open up a space for a critique of violence in your texts?     
5. Reader Complicity and American Psycho. We’ve talked at length about different ways in which the reader of Ellis’ American Psycho is made a part of the text, or addressed by it, sutured to it, bound up in it without an exit, etc. Formulate an argument about the complicity of the reader, using specific textual evidence to support your claim about how the reader is in relation to Ellis’ novel.  Or does the reader have different poles / modes of engagement over the course of the novel? What is the reader’s “work” in relation to the novel: as co-doer of violence; as assaulted victim; as narrative agency; as detached viewer; as consumer? What is at stake in thinking about the reader as Bateman, as aggressor, as victim?  Is complicity the same as recognition or identification?  Does the novel give us clues as to how it views the figure of the reader (which is not necessarily the same as its own reader)?  Bateman, after all, is a consumer of popular culture; is he also a “reader” or critic of it?  Is reading different from consuming, or a form of it?  Or do you want to redefine the question and suggest that the reader of this novel is not a “reader” in a traditional sense (making meaning, identifying, understanding, interpreting, taking a text apart, seeing underneath/behind it)? Is this novel doing something affective with the figure of the reader? Boring it? Baiting it? Making it endure or witness something?    
6. Red and White and Black. Choose two of the following films: American History X; Fargo; American Psycho; Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer and make an argument about the use of color in relation to your chosen texts.  You’ll want to carefully trace how color is used, deployed, structured, destructured, nuanced, multiplied, staged, etc. in your films and make an argument for how the relation(s) of color gives us an understanding of some larger dimension of each film: its relation to critique; its relation to violence; to history; to language; to bodies; to power; to racial connotations of white / black / red; etc.  This is another way of saying you’ll explore how formal issues relate to ones of content.  As you analyze how color(s) appear, how they work across the text as a whole, how they change or modify over the course of the work, and the specific lines, shapes and blocks  3  21L.435 Violence and Contemporary Representation Questions for Paper # 1   they take, you’ll want to consider both color as an aesthetic or formal element and as representations (so, for example, red as both red and as blood; or as culinary ornament and spilled interior of the meat of the body)… Does color undergo distortion or change over the course of each text, or do your different films use color differently?  Is there a logic or narrative related to color or is it linked to spectacle, excess, what resists language, logic, narrative? Why would a critic interested in violence attend to color at all? You might end by examining whether form colludes with violence or mitigates it.  Is color relevant to how spectators engage with violence, trauma, disturbing forces, or is color linked to a dominance of style that aestheticizes, sanitizes and makes it easier to consume violent images?   
7. Violence, Looking, and Videotape(s). Consider and describe reflexive moments of videotaping or watching scenes of violence in any two of our texts to date, and make an argument about how these works use embedded screens or reflexive references to mediation as either an agent of violence or for a critique of violence. You might think about the videotape scenes in American Psycho (the film) or the famous video-rewatching scene in Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer; you might also want to consider the role of videotapes in the narrative of Ellis’ novel, the video interviews in American History X, and even the function of watching television in Fargo. Recording is of something “live” to be played back at a later time: some of our films show the “live” recording; others rewatch/repeat it after the fact; these notions of liveness might be contrasted to a deathliness in rewatching… perhaps. Is there a logic to embedded scenes of videography; how is filming a victim linked diegetically to violence and/or how is showing us violence through embedded filming linked to a critique of violence?  Does putting a diegetic frame around violence make the violence more violent, or more distant; does it increase the affective experience or mitigate it?  Is watching violence (diegetically) pleasurable or unpleasurable?  Are there ways of connecting our spectatorial work to these scenes of people watching terrible things?  (Or forced to watch terrible things? Unable to look away…) Are there ways of watching filmed violence that are more or less complicit with violence?  How do different looks function in the texts you’ve chosen; are there looks that undo or work against violence?   
8. Consumerism, Commodities, Banking. Choose one or two of the following: American Psycho (the novel); American Psycho (the film); Fargo; Se7en. Consider and make an argument about the role of capitalism, consumerism, big corporations, commodity culture, conspicuous consumption, or banking in relation to your texts. What is your texts’ reading or figuration of your chosen figure of late capitalist economics?  (This ranges from the literal appearance of banks in American Psycho and loans in Fargo to more abstract figurations such as “consumption.”  You can take this question any direction that interests you.)   What is the relationship between violence and economics, according to your chosen texts?  Is there a necessary or inevitable link between the economic sphere and violence, or is your text suggesting a more complex model?  Is there any way of breaking or undoing or challenging that relationship according to your texts?  What does it mean to make a system,  4  21L.435 Violence and Contemporary Representation Questions for Paper # 1   abstraction or collective (such as “capitalism” or “corporations”) the agent of violence?  What critical problems arise in relation to that claim?  Likewise, your chosen text(s) may well still focus on a singular protagonist or representative of an entire system: what is the relationship between individuals and the economic critique your texts are positing?      
9.  The Real, Realism and Expressionism. Consider and make an argument about the “real” in relation to two of the following texts: Fargo; American Psycho (the novel or the film); Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer; Se7en. What is function of discourses of “the real” in your texts (real places, real histories, real objects, real people)? Or, in turn, you could consider realism. The real is different from realism, which is an aesthetic meant to evoke or replicate our ordinary world: how do your texts (especially if you’ve chosen to write on Henry, Se7en or the film of American Psycho) deploy a realist aesthetic?  Relatedly, how do they deploy the opposite: an expressionist aesthetic (marked by self-conscious stylization, notable aesthetics, and a distorted view of bodies/the world)?  Consider Freeland’s argument in your analysis. How is violence differently negotiated by a realist vs. expressionist aesthetic?    5  MIT OpenCourseWarehttp://ocw.mit.eduCMS.840 / 21L.435 At the Limit: Violence in Contemporary RepresentationFall 2013For information about citing these materials or our Terms of Use, visit: http://ocw.mit.edu/terms.
1.  Splicing and the Cut.  Pick one or two of the following: Fight Club (the novel); Fight Club (the film); Frisk.  Consider and make an argument about the figure of splicing or the cut—you should articulate your sense of what that figure is, means, or does—in relation to your chosen text(s).   Splicing involves conjoining the disparate, so it’s a figure of unity and difference at once.  You can be literal or metaphorical here; this can be an aesthetic problem, a bodily problem, a structural problem, and so forth—just be clear about how you’re writing of the figure.  Splicing might be a material gesture, one linked to media like photography or the editing in cinema (Tyler’s nighttime repasts); it might be a violent gesture, linked to interruption, intermittency, or fragmentation (as in Cooper).  At minimum, it involves conjoining the separate, which means it’s a figure that troubles the relation between unity and dehiscence.  You may want to speculate in your conclusion on how splicing affects or  1 21L.435 Violence and Contemporary Representation Questions for Paper # 2  Consider not only how your text(s) represent or depict rape (visually, formally,   relates to critical approaches to your chosen text(s); do we have to read or approach the splice in a specific critical manner; what splices into criticism, or, by contrast, does criticism conjoin or suture over such rends?   
2.  Men and Women and Rape.  Pick one or two of the following: Frisk; A ma soeur; Audition.  Consider and make an argument about the figure of rape in relation to your chosen text(s)—you should articulate your sense of what that figure is, means, or does, because you may want to take rape as a broad figure of forced insertion/penetration, as a scene of unspecified sexual assault, or as a more literal figuration.  But several of these texts pose the question, “What is rape, actually?”, so the figure is quite complex and you should articulate how you’re defining/figuring it.  narratively, linguistically) but also how the (con)text for those scene(s) suggests a reading of rape.  Do these films self-analyze or articulate a critique of how they represent (or deploy, or use, or theorize) rape?  Does rape stand for a logic of something else (seduction; desire; familial love) taken to its extreme?  Is rape the “worst” form of violence in your chosen text(s); does it have a kind of violent specificity, or is it “just another form of assault”?  I strongly recommend considering in your conclusion: What are the critical implications of diegetic/narrative contestations over rape?  (In other words, what are the critical implications of “rape” being a contested site within a text?)   
3.  Time and Deferral.  Compare (and contrast, and complexify) the relation between deferral and duration in Audition and A ma soeur.  Both films have very interesting narrative structures, and one could argue (many have argued) that both defer or put off the scene(s) of their most infamous violence.  Do you agree?  Disagree?  Want to quibble?  Do we have to define violence in a certain way to see it as deferred? No matter how you negotiate the above questions, in your essay you should make an argument about how the temporal form of each film relates to violence, and you should articulate an explicit, theorized relationship between the “early” parts of each film, and the “later” or “final” parts.  Do you agree that violence is deferred to the end, or do you see strains/traces of it earlier in the work?  What is the spectatorial effect or consequence of the formal logic for which you are arguing?  How does this understanding change on (re)viewing the texts (something you should absolutely do for this paper).  Can you speculate on the broader relationship between deferral, duration and violence?  How would the films have been different with a different formal relationship to time and narrative?   
4.  Words, words, words.  Consider the role of talking, language, negotiation, persuasion, confession (and so forth) in one or two of the following: Fight Club (the  2 21L.435 Violence and Contemporary Representation Questions for Paper # 2    novel); Frisk; A ma soeur. Articulate how you take language here: as tone or sound, as bodily speech, as narrative, as a form of too-much- or not-enough-ness, as rhetoric (persuasion), as confession or revelation, as full or as empty, as truth (for deception, see question #5, below).  Make an argument about the form, function and role of words, language, oral dictates, speaking (and the speakable/unspeakable), rhetoric (however you focus this topic) in relation to your chosen text(s).  What kinds or pluralities of language-forms and -functions do you read in your text(s).  How does language appear: as too-much, as not-enough; as meaning, as failures of or gaps in meaning; as seduction/persuasion; as logic or as emotion; as grotesque and empty or as exciting or bland?  Every essay should make a connection between language and violence: is language the vehicle for violence (its medium; how it is transmitted)—and, if so, what are the consequences of that for readers or spectators?  Is language the cause of violence; is language the consequence of violence?  Does language promote or amplify violence or mitigate or calm it?  Consider the implications for your own form of criticism on your chosen text(s), which is itself another production of more words, words, words…   
5.  Lies, lies, lies.  Choose two of the following: Fight Club (the novel); Fight Club (the film); Frisk; Audition; A ma soeur.  Analyze and make an argument about the figure of the lie, betrayal, bent truth, partial truths, revelations of previous deception—and articulate how you’re approaching this figure—in relation to your chosen text(s).  Who (is lied to; this is not always obvious); how, where, when and in what way does it take place in your chosen text(s)?  Definitely consider whether (and if so, how; if not, what then) the reader or spectator is told the truth or told forms of lying.  Is every lie always a betrayal?  Can a lie also every reveal a truth?   Are some lies worse (or more violent, or more linked to violence) than others?   You may want to consider: What is the temporality of the lie: does it matter when it’s revealed to have been a lie?  What do you make of your text if it troubles the neat binary between truth and lie: where is that distinction made impossible to determine?  How do different texts lie: i.e. a novel versus a film? I strongly recommend considering in your conclusion the critical upshot of your argument about how your texts navigate this terrain; specifically: What is the consequence of how your texts grapple with figurations of the lie for a critical reading of violence in your chosen text(s)?   
6.  The child.  Working with Frisk or A ma soeur (or both), consider and make an argument about violence and the child.  What is the signifier “child” to your text?  How does that get permuted or modified over the course of the novel or film (does the “child” come to be or represent new/different things, or is that status solidified, essentialized over the course of the text)?  Is the child a figure of guilt or innocence (and whose guilt or innocence)?  Is the child a form of time (new time; future time; corruptible time;  3 21L.435 Violence and Contemporary Representation Questions for Paper # 2   irrecoverable time)?  Is the child a figure in a family, in other words a relational figure, or is the child its own independent thing?    Consider how the child relates to violence (agent of, cause of, provoker of, victim of, witness to, field for thinking about…)?  We’ll stipulate that violence against a child is a particularly powerful, strong cultural taboo: how do your texts deploy that, formally, in relation to the reader/spectator?  Is violence against or with or in relation to the child meant to conjure negative affects: shock, disgust, horror, terror, revulsion, anxiety, etc., or more positive/recuperative forms: empathy, pathos, affection, love, tenderness?     
7.  The Trace/the Scar/the Mark — Choose two of the following: Fight Club (the novel); Fight Club (the film); Frisk; Audition.  Analyze and make an argument about the figure of the trace, the scar, the (birth)mark—and articulate how you’re approaching or limiting or defining this figure—in relation to your chosen text(s).  What is the relationship of the trace or scar or mark to time, to history, to meaning (or non-meaning), to writing/inscription, to legibility (or illegibility)?  What is its relation to love, erotics, intimacy, closeness?  How is it made in each work (i.e. how does it come into being)?  And, above all, what is the relation of the trace, scar, or mark to violence: is it something that makes violence comprehensible or marks it as incomprehensible?  You may want to consider: Is it something that enables violence to circulate among or for forming communities (is the scar seductive; does it recruit figures to violence) or, rather, is it something that posits separation and difference?  Are these marks giving us a theory of the body?  As a form of truth?  Or as deceptive?  Is the photograph a kind of scar or mark? Or are specific media forms within your texts scarred or marked, as though they too were a body?  What is the consequence of how your texts grapple with figurations of the trace/scar/mark for a critical reading of your chosen text(s)’ theories of violence (as destruction or creation? As undoing or as additive? As ugly or as beautiful? —You can take this in many directions…)   4 MIT OpenCourseWarehttp://ocw.mit.eduCMS.840 / 21L.435 At the Limit: Violence in Contemporary RepresentationFall 2013For information about citing these materials or our Terms of Use, visit: http://ocw.mit.edu/terms.
1.  Pain.  Consider either Scarry’s epistemology of pain or Sontag’s ethics of regarding the pain of others, and read it in relation to one or two texts: Reservoir Dogs; Oldboy; Funny Games; and Benny’s Video might all work especially well here.  Articulate how your see your chosen theorist defining and accounting for images of pain: what kinds of problems emerge when talking about the pain of others?  How do your chosen texts present or grapple with pain as a problem?  Do 1At the Limit: Violence and Contemporary Representation Guidelines for Final Paper, p. 2   they concur with your theorist, or argue for another relation to pain?  How do the texts represent the regarding of pain (in the text) and how does this relate to our spectatorial regarding of pain?  Is there an aesthetic of regarding the pain of others?  A politics?  An ethics to it?  What kinds of critical problems are present when dealing with representations of the pain of others?  Does it demand a different approach, or a specific mode of critique?  Is pain different from other things we can regard?  What is the relationship between violence and pain?  Do your texts bind those terms together or do they de-couple them?     
2.  Violence and Humor/Violence and Laughter.  Choose two texts and consider the relationship between humor and violence in them.  Consider the cartoonish; the absurd; gross-out humor; splatter; camp; parody.  Or, you might focus on laughter more specifically and write an argument about its specific usage (or related forms: the smirk and wink in Funny Games; the laugh track in Natural Born Killers—that use of the word track is so very interesting; the absurd or surreal or ironic in Man Bites Dog, etc.)  Be specific in how you define your terms and how your films deploy the figure you define: how do the texts use humor, and how or where do they fail to use it?  Is humor in the image?  In the use of sound?  In the narrative?  In juxtaposition or incongruity?  Is it in absurdity?  Are there several or different modes of humor in your very violent texts?  Do the texts change their approach or tone in regards to humor over the course of the text?  (If so, what is the tipping point in which tone shifts?)  What does the usage of humor in any form mean in a text that is about violence: is violence presented humorously, is humor presented violently?  What does it mean for a text to juxtapose those two figures?  What does it mean for spectatorship?  What does it mean for criticism?  Is humor a way of downplaying violence, or can it make violence more violent?  What are the ethics of deploying humor in this way?    
3.  Violence, Looking, and Videotape(s).  Consider and describe reflexive moments of videotaping or watching scenes of violence in two texts; make an argument about how these films use embedded screens or reflexive references to mediation as either an agent of violence or for a critique of violence; and make use of Bazin’s argument about obscenity and death and time in formulating your argument (do you agree with him? do your films complicate his account? etc.).  Consider Man Bites Dog; Natural Born Killers; Funny Games; Benny’s Video; and/or Tesis. Is there a logic to embedded scenes of videography; how is filming a victim linked diegetically to violence and/or how is showing us violence through embedded filming linked to a critique of violence?  Does putting a diegetic frame around violence make the violence more violent, or more distant; does it increase the affective experience or mitigate it?  Is watching violence (diegetically) pleasurable or unpleasurable?  Are there ways of connecting our spectatorial work to these scenes of people watching terrible things?  Are there ways of watching filmed violence that are more or less complicit with violence?  How do different looks function in the texts you’ve chosen; are there looks that undo violence? 2At the Limit: Violence and Contemporary Representation Guidelines for Final Paper, p. 3      
4. Noise. Water. Meat. [ EB: This is the title of a fantastic book about the uses of sound in contemporary art, each of these titular words being ways in which sound is generated in different practices…  It obviously also has other resonances in the context of our course; I couldn’t resist. ]  Pick two texts and make an argument about their use of sound (including: voice, music, effects, noise, silence; but also: the muffled, the distinct, the loud, the whispering, the fragile, the painful, the hard and rhythmic, the lyrical and languid) and how that use of sound relates to violence.  You’ll want to make sure you have a grasp on some language for the analysis of sound (diegetic/extradiegetic; timbre; frequency; pitch; sound and/vs. image; on- vs. off-screen sound —talk to me if you’re not sure), and you’ll want to be clear on how the sonic as such (not words as they mean, but words as they sound) relates to violence.  You might also consider a sonic figure such as laughter; the scream; breathing; gasping; suffocating; televisual or media noise; and read that figure in relation to violence.  How does sound work in the text, and how does sound work on spectators?  Does sound seem to have a privileged relationship to violence that is different from either language or the image’s relationship?  Why is that; what does that mean for thinking about violent texts?     
5.  Time and Duration.  Pick two texts and think about the figure of time, temporality, and duration.  Make an argument about how the texts deal with the problem of time: historical time; memorialized time; felt time (duration; boredom); the time of trauma; the time of grief; the time of shock; quick time; long time; familial time; the past; the present; the future; story vs. plot time; anachronies (narrative out of linear time); etc.  Every paper will want to create an argument about the relationship between time and violence, and speculate in the conclusion on the significance of that argued-for relationship.  This topic would work especially well for Reservoir Dogs; Oldboy; Funny Games; and/or Benny’s Video. Speculate on the broader relationship between time, duration and violence.  How would the texts have been different with a different formal relationship to time and narrative?  Do we experience violence in time, or as something that punctures or destroys or exists outside of time?  Does time lessen violence or exacerbate it?  Does time mitigate certain forms of violence, but amplify others?  If you relate representations of time to felt/spectatorial time, what is that relationship?  What is the time of spectatorship, and how does that relate to violence?    
6.  Form and Content.  Choose any two or three texts and make an argument about the relationship between form (how the work is structured) and content (more on that in a moment).  You’ll want to identify and focus on key formal traits—don’t just list them or move from trait to trait—and analyze how they appear, how they work across the text as a whole, 3At the Limit: Violence and Contemporary Representation Guidelines for Final Paper, p. 4  how they change or modify over the course of the work.  This is an enormous topic, with lots of potential directions; formal traits might include: style; a certain use of editing; light; color; visual composition; repetition; hyperbole; overloading or exhaustion; voice; tone; surface relations; blankness (literal: whiteness; or metaphorical: emptiness); a relation to staging (of bodies; of representation).    Consider how form relates to what you take to be the content of the text.  This may not be an easy and neat distinction.  Make an argument about it: does form collude with violence or mitigate it?  Is form how meaning is conveyed or is form the meaning of your work?  (And if so, what does that in fact mean?)    
7.  Is it the case that we are what we  _________________?        document? televise? aestheticize? stylize? study? watch? critique?  Choose two texts and make an argument that it is or is not the case that we are what we ___________.  You can pick your own formulation from the above, or generate your own.  Make an argument about how you see your chosen texts posing, exploring and either answering or suspending this question.  Compare and contrast how each text deals with this formulation, and speculate on the significance of their relations or differences in how they address it.  Every paper should address the significance of this formulation in the specific case of violent texts.  Your conclusion should reflect on the significance of the fleshed-out formulation: what does it mean for that final figure (those who document; those who watch; those who study/critique)?  What do we do with this formulation: does it teach us about violence?  Does it demand a certain adoption or refraining from some activity or gesture?  Does it require a new or different method of critique or thinking or writing (about violence)?    And, finally, you were waiting for it, right?   
8.  What is “violence”?  No, really: what is it?  Is it, in fact, a “what,” or is that ontological word the wrong figure to use?  Is “violence” in another form: the who; the when; the where; the how?  Can we only speak of violences?  Is it something that resists definition?  Something that changes depending on critical approaches?  Choose at least two texts from the last half of our semester (though you could work on more if you wanted to create a taxonomy of types; we can talk about this) and analyze how they define, present, trouble, complicate, etc. “violence.”  These texts can include films, novels, but also critical texts (Sontag, Scarry, etc.).  Articulate 4At the Limit: Violence and Contemporary Representation Guidelines for Final Paper, p. 5  their definitions of violence (which you may have to extrapolate or argue for), and make a tight, coherent argument about how to think about “violence” in light of these offerings.  Do you want to quibble with, disagree with, totally reject, these definitions?    You should offer or speculate on a positive definition of violence that encompasses the complexities of the term that you want to see… do any of your chosen texts get close to that definition?  If “violence” is not definable, are there texts that suggest just that?  Every paper should consider this: What does it mean for criticism to define “violence” or to be unable to define it?  How does one begin to write about it, then?      *** OR, you can design your own topic in consultation with me—  Be sure to remember that this is designed to let you speak to your particular intellectual If you want to do this, go ahead and write it out as though it were a topic (you don’t have to have quite as many sub-questions as I like to, but give it a term/concept/topic and generate a few questions that your topic will pose).  You must meet with me to talk about a paper topic you design on your own so I can make sure it’s a fitting scope.  Plan on meeting with me at least a week before the paper is due; you can come to office hours or email to set up an appointment   interests, but that doesn’t mean choosing a final paper topic is a free for all.  Your final paper must speak, in some way, to central issues that have come up in this class, and must be about violence in contemporary representation, even as you may want to problematize any of those terms.  So, for example, “I want to write about the history of the MPAA regulations in the late 1960s and how Bonnie and Clyde changed the aesthetic representation of violence” is not a topic that sufficiently grows out of our class material, as it’s outside of our historical era, and involves methods more appropriate to a film history course.  However, “I want to write about the relationship between flat, quick, banal representations of violence and more elaborate, aestheticized, choreographed violence, focusing on three films from our class” is a viable topic.    If you want to put course material in dialogue with material that we haven’t focused on in class, that’s fine, but it will need to address at least one of our texts and be in dialogue with conceptual issues we have discussed.  If, for example, you really wanted to write on “torture porn” and ultraviolent recent horror films, that’s fine and we can make that possible as one of your texts, and a conceptual area like pain—but you would want to contextualize that discussion in relation to certain films we watched, such as Funny Games, and you would need to make reference to the readings we did on pain. In short, think about your paper topic this way: it should start with our course material, especially that of the last third of the course; it should engage films and readings we’ve looked at; and, if you then want to, you can go from there.     5MIT OpenCourseWarehttp://ocw.mit.eduCMS.840 / 21L.435 At the Limit: Violence in Contemporary RepresentationFall 2013For information about citing these materials or our Terms of Use, visit: http://ocw.mit.edu/terms.
