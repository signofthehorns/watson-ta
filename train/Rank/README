1. Create the training data file 
To see an example of a working training file, look at hist_questions.csv
notice that the syntax is a question, followed by an id of the entry in the collection that it matches, followed by the relevance of the entry
(make sure to include quotations).

aka for
"What is Beringia","3","1"

the question is "What is Beringia"...
the id of the entry that matches is "3"...
and the rating of the ranking is "1" (for my training set I only used the value 1)

Note:
You can include more than one entry id and ranking relevancy per line (even though I only used one).
so 
"What is Beringia","3","1","2","1","5","1"
would also be valid, and would suggest the entries with ids 3,2,and 5 in the collection would match the question

2. Training
to train the ranker for a specific collection run the following command
 (notice that 'history_collection_with_rank' is the name of the collection && 'History Ranker is the name of the Ranker')
python ./train.py -u $watson_rr_username:$watson_rr_password -i hist_questions.csv -c $watson_rr_cluster_id -x history_collection_with_rank -n "History Ranker"

3. Training Status
